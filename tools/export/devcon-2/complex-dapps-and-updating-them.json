  "description": "This presentation by Joey Krug of Augur, will show how Augur has setup its contracts such that the business and storage logic are separate. Joey will go over different ways to upgrade contracts (as well as the way theyâ€™re settled on), and discuss why Augur thinks this separation of data and logic should be the pattern going forward for larger sets of contracts as it enables easier upgrade and bug fixing paths.",
