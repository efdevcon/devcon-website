  "description": "For the last three years since I joined the Web3 industry, I mainly worked as a product manager, discovering, shaping, and developing different Web3 projects. For the last year and a half, I joined our R&D department and focused on generating and validating early-stage ideas while focusing on cutting-edge technology. I worked and shaped most of the 3327 experiment (https://3327.io/projects/) and worked on MVPWâ€™s products (https://mvpworkshop.co/portfolio/) https://bit.ly/3AbLPAC",
