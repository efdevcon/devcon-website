  "description": "Andy Boyan, PhD.'s past life as a Professor of Communication led him deep into the weeds of social science exploration of game mechanics and player effects. Turning this experience to Web3 after going down the 2017 crypto rabbit hole, Andy worked for Status, Ava Labs, and Chainlink Labs before Co-Founding Infinity Keys, creator tools for providing Web3 treasure hunt questing. He is definitely not an agent of the Elder Gods come to prepare the earth for a cold reign of starlit oblivion.",
