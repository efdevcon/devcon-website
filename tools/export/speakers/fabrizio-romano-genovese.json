  "description": "I work at the intersection of category theory, a super abstract branch of maths, and crypto: I focus on applying very general mathematical techniques to problems such as protocol design and MEV. I am interested in compositional design, correct by construction code, open games, formal verification. I did my PhD in categorical quantum mechanics at Oxford, where I learned compositional methods, and worked for years with Statebox, developing correct-by-construction graphical programming languages.",
