  "description": "Sarah Friend (@isthisanart_) is an artist and software engineer working with Ethereum for almost three years now. When not doing that, she creates games and other interactive experiences. Her practice investigates murky dichotomies - like those between privacy and transparency, centralization and decentralization, and the environment and technology - with playfulness and absurdist humour. She is a proud Recurse Center alum, and has presented at Transmediale in Berlin, Ethereal Summit in NYC, and NorthSec in Montreal.  She was recently chosen as one of Canada's 30 under 30 developers, is one of the organizers of Our Networks, a conference on all aspects of the distributed web in Toronto."
