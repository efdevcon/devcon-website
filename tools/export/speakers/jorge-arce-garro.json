  "description": "I am a blockchain and cryptography researcher from Costa Rica, currently working at Nethermind. I look into all kinds of tools related to Ethereum scalability questions, such as layer 2s, liquid staking, and zero-knowledge proofs. Besides Ethereum, I am working on a PhD in mathematical physics at the University of Michigan.  In my free time I enjoy memes and dancing.",
