  "description": "I was formerly the engineering lead at Truebit, a protocol for verifiable offchain computation for scalability on Ethereum. I developed the first implementation (link below), wrote our WebAssembly virtual machine spec (link below). I also helped launch ETHPrize (ethprize.io) to help pinpoint open problems in the Ethereum ecosystem and fund resources towards them. I have presented on scalability at numerous conferences – EthDenver, the San Francisco and Silicon Valley Ethereum Meetups, Ethcc, amongst others (links below). • Truebit demo by me:<div></div> <div></div>\n• Truebit WebAssembly VM spec: https://github.com/TrueBitFoundation/wiki/blob/master/docs/vm_spec.md • Our presentation at Ethcc on ETHPrize: <div></div> <div></div>\n• Truebit’s approach to scaling at ScalingNow conference: <div></div> <div></div>\n• My website: http://sinahab.com • My twitter: https://twitter.com/sinahab • My Github: http://github.com/sinahab"
