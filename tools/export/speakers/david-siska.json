  "description": "I am currently a Head of Research at Vega protocol and Associate Professor of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. I've been interested in programming from an early age, oscillating between applied problems (coding) and theoretical (mathematics). At Vega I am mainly focused on whole system modelling, design validation and development of new protocol features. My maths research is on the theoretical aspects of reinforcement learning and optimal control algorithms.",
