  "description": "The workshop will teach some of the most useful algorithms and tricks needed to analyse and decompile an EVM smart contract: symbolic execution, memory modelling, loop handling and so on.Techniques shown during the workshop are useful in anything related to contract analysis - from writing your own decompiler, through using existing tools like Eveem, Mythril or Manticore, to working with formal verification K Lab style. Based on the experience from building Eveem.org decompiler and analysing all the bytecodes on the Ethereum blockchain.",
