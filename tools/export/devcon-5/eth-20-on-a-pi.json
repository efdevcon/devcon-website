  "description": "Throughout the years, one of the main complaints of blockchains and Ethereum has been how much energy it consumes to secure transactions. Thus, blockchain is often associated with energy waste in mainstream views. Eth 2.0 with its proof-of-stake consensus promises significantly improved energy consumption. It also brings back validation power to common hardware while proof-of-work increasingly requires interested parties to invest in specialized hardware, space and location. Let's dive together to see if the beacon chain holds those promises and run it on one of the most accessible hardware: the Raspberry Pi.",
