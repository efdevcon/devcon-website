  "description": "This talk is aimed at bringing depth to the conversation of mass adoption by defining concepts such as ‘UX’, ‘Education’, and ‘User’. It is commonly pointed  out that in order to drive mass adoption, “UX is critical” and “We need to educate users”. Is this true? What does this look like in practice? And what can we do to get the UX right? In this talk I’ll provide actionable suggestions based on  stablished frameworks on the psychology of technology adoption as well as anecdotes from UX research at Status; where over the last year we have surveyed over 300 people, talked to ca. 50 people in usability testing and field research, and received numerous valuable requests in Status’ public channels. Suggestions include for example how to design user interfaces in which people can safely learn from mistakes and interactions that satisfy the human need to connect with family and friends.",
