  "title": "Off-Chain Trusted Compute Overlay testnet for Blockchain Privacy, Scalability and Adaptability.",
  "description": "During Devcon 4 we introduced potential for Trusted Compute as an option for addressing scalability and privacy challenges faced by blockchains. Since then Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) has released version 1.0 of Off-chain Trusted Compute specification. As part of the workshop we will introduce an Enterprise Ethereum network connected to EEA compliant Trusted Computing pool; both hosted on Azure cloud. In addition we will demonstrate one sample real-world usage scenario and give examples of more. During the workshop developers will be provided scripts to recreate the setup on their local laptops and guidance on how to create private test setups on Azure cloud. Developers will walk away with background on leveraging Trusted Compute in context of their decentralized applications for addressing privacy, scalability and/or adaptability.",
