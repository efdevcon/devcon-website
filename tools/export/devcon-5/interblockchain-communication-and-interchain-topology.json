  "description": "The interblockchain community protocol will faciliate permissionless interoperation between smart contracts on Ethereum 1.0/1.x & Ethereum 2.0, Cosmos zones, Polkadot parachains, Bitcoin & more. The first half of this talk presents the protocol construction, notes security properties & consensus requirements, explains the message channel interface exposed to smart contracts & modules, and discusses special techniques for bridging Nakamoto proof-of-work consensus blockchains such as Ethereum 1.0/1.x to chains with finality. The second half embarks on a speculative exploration of what the future topology of interconnected blockchains might look like: what economic constraints might shape cross-chain design choices, what kinds of applications might most benefit from cross-chain logic, and what shared ecosystem standards might most effectively facilitate positive-sum interoperation, with particular attention to integration into the Ethereum 2.0 specification process.",
