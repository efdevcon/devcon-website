  "title": "When blockchain meets legal design: UX challenges in the world's first decentralized court.",
  "description": "Legal technology guru Richard Susskind said: 'Online courts are not an alternative to the justice system. They are the justice system. In 10 years, more cases will be settled online than offline'. Decentralized courts built on blockchain technology will play a key role in this transformation. But this will pose great challenges, as people aren't used to online trials. This talk will explore the role of UX design to contribute to this transition. In particular, it will focus on the intersection between UX design and legal design, a breakthrough method developed at Stanfordâ€™s Legal Design Lab which advocates the use of design thinking principles into legal software products. We will illustrate concepts with examples of UX challenges faced at Kleros, a blockchain dispute resolution DApp, and discuss the design decisions, what worked and what didn't. Finally, we will distill some UX insights for creating user-friendly, accessible, and engaging solutions for the coming age of legal Dapps",
