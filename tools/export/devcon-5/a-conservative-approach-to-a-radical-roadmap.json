  "title": "A Conservative Approach to a Radical Roadmap",
  "description": "The current Ethereum 2.0 roadmap is doing a lot of great work on many fronts such as research on VDFs, data availability proofs, and multi-execution environments.  However, as an active observer of the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap development over the past 2 years, I am concerned with some of the choices in roadmap strategy, particularly its approach to radically transforming a network with over $30B of value and hundreds of applications depending on it.  In this talk, I will present an alternative, more conservative view of how to approach the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap.  Some of the topics covered will include: - Radical vs Conservative technological upgrade paths. - We should use Ethereum 1.x as the beacon chain instead of launching a new beacon chain. - Proof of Stake is highly experimental.  We should test Proof of Stake on shards before using it on the beacon chain. - Why requiring a 1-way peg burn of ETH to stake is scary. - Learnings from 3 months of Proof of Stake on Cosmos - Why we NEED delegation *in-protocol* - Why sharding doesn't solve social scalability.",
