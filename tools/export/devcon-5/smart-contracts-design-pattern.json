This talk features a live demo of the development tool Piet and its plugin to access a catalog of smart contract pattern and anti-pattern.  The presented Piet plugin queries existing pattern registries, categorizes them and presents the patterns in an enhanced way. A pattern view in Piet consists of its inheritance graph, an example implementation, a description, curated comments and a graphical interface to interact with deployed example contracts.  The curated comments are way to inform the developer regarding issues related to this pattern which are not included in the original description.",
