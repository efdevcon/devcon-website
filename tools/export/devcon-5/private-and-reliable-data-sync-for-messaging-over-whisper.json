  "description": "How do we achieve user friendly data sync in a p2p network for resource restricted devices? In this talk we go over the problem space, do a brief survey of existing work, and propose a solution combining several of the most promising technologies. This talk will include a demo of a data sync protocol being developed. We’ll also cover things such as: - dealing with mostly-offline devices, - dealing with large sync contexts, such as group chats - making the protocol transport-agnostic. Finally, we’ll show how data sync fits into the larger picture, from transport layer to end user applications, and highlight some of the work that still needs to be done, and who is working on it.",
