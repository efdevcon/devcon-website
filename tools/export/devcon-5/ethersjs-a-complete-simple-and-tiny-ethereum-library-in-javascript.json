  "title": "ethers.js - A Complete, Simple and Tiny Ethereum Library in JavaScript",
  "description": "The ethers.js library provides a complete, easy-to-use JavaScript library for developers to create dapp frontends and backends, Ethereum frameworks, tools and wallets.It provides all the APIs and utilities needed to query and connect safely and securely (optionally infrastructure-free) to a variety of backends, create JavaScript objects representations of  smart contracts and their state, sign and manage transactions and format content for display logic and parse user input.This talk will quickly cover many of these features, provide examples of common tasks, and demonstrate a few less-obviously-dangerous, but easy-to-make mistakes  (with solutions).",
