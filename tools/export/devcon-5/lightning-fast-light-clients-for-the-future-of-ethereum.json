  "title": "Lightning fast light clients for the future of Ethereum",
  "description": "The presentation focuses on recent developments of the Go Ethereum light client project (LES) and their relevance for both ETH1.x and ETH2.0. Significant progress has been made towards an efficient and truly decentralized network incentivization model. In addition to solving the hard problem of LES service availability, it can also serve as a PoC for our future networks where a proper incentivization layer will be key to a scalable and reliable infrastructure. The talk covers the following topics: - the challenges of creating a healthy service market in a low-trust environment - building trust between pseudonymous participants without central authorities - guarantees for good performance and quick response times - a two-layered model that allows using different pricing schemes on top of a common simple base layer - more advanced applications and network topologies - a quick demo of how you can already use micropayments with LES",
