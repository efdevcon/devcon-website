  "description": "Infura engineers have found unique ways to utilize tools openly available in cloud provider offerings to reduce the time to sync Ethereum nodes and run them reliably. At DevCon5 we’d like to share this new architecture paradigm so that other development teams will be able to utilize the same tools that we do to run their own reliable infrastructure. We first launched at Devcon2 as a handful of nodes and a simple architecture. We’ve scaled and iterated on our architecture for API traffic that grew from millions to billions of requests per day-- serving applications like Metamask, MyCrypto, Coinbase Wallet, Opera, and Brave Browser.  Infura makes it easier for developers to build on Ethereum. During this talk, we’ll share our findings on scaling access to blockchain data. We’ll also discuss ways on how to efficiently cache blockchain data for the JSON-RPC API. We’ll talk about what worked and what didn’t so that others can learn from our applied research.",
