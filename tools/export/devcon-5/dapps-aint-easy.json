  "description": "Along with my job at OpenZeppelin, I spent the last year writing a book on Ethereum for traditional web developers new to the space. While writing, I found that many things that we take for granted when coding on Ethereum are much more difficult to get right than we think.  On this lightning talk, we will briefly present overlooked challenges on gas estimations, handling reorganizations, and even managing subscriptions. Though there will be no silver bullet solution to close, we will discuss what we can do as an ecosystem to mitigate these problems.",
