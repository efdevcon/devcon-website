  "title": "Putting Eth2.0 To Work",
  "description": "There is much excitement around Ethereum 2.0 but given the fast pace of the project it can be hard to keep up. The relationship between today's Ethereum and the new system can be murky:  does eth2.0 replace eth1.0? And where does eth1.x fit in?This talk answers these questions by sketching the lesser known ways eth2.0 can directly benefit Ethereum 1.x. The two systems in fact complement each other as each phase of eth2.0 paves the way for tangible benefits to the network we all know and love. With Phase 0, we can upgrade Ethereum with the finality gadget, leveraging the proof-of-stake consensus to provide better security for the existing chain. With Phase 1, the proof-of-work chain can use the data-only shards to enhance the scalability of L2 solutions like zk-rollup and Plasma. With Phase 2, we can bring existing dApps into the realm of highly scalable smart contracts on shards with an upgraded virtual machine.Participants will gain a better understanding of the many ways eth2.0 can help scalability in the near term and onward into the future. While the journey there may be dynamic and winding, it is clear that the future of Ethereum is bright.",
