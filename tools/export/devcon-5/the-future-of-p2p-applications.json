  "description": "The web today is dominated by the monopolies that won the internet land grab. I personally spent 10 years working for these companies, working on Google Cloud infrastructure as well as Gmail and Google's collaboration apps. It's a hard engineering problem to solve, but we should be able to coordinate work on Devcon6 using decentralized tools. To provide people with an alternative where they own their data, we’ve build p2p replacement for Google Docs and Slack that works in the browser. For 18 months leading up to Devcon5 we’ve been working on creating open source network for p2p applications. To build out the underlying p2p stack for the whole decentralized ecosystem, we also led team of p2p projects/experts to create p2p-ecosystem report and  position paper where everyone agrees on highest impact work to be funded. As the next step we've also built p2p focused DAO on Ethereum to distribute grants with initial $400k funding.",
