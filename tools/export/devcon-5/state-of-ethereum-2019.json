  "description": "We last presented at Devcon 3 Cancun. Fast forward to 2019, we explore how the network has evolved and grown since by looking at the overall top stats. As Developers, to build better dApps it is also essential to understand the user base we are serving. Using analytics data, we look at the changing user demographics of the Ethereum eco-system, learn & discover what the Ethereum \"User Persona\" looks like today vs 2 years ago, has it changed or largely remained the same over time? And while it goes without saying that building technical infrastructure is challenging, there are also unique non-technical issues in delivering basic essential infrastructure service to the community. We share some of these challenges, scaling issues and what we learned.",
