  "description": "One of the most interesting innovations to come out of the cocreation in the Genesis Alpha DAO (DAOStack's first DAO) - The DAO Design Canvas Workshop utilizes a canvas-like tool developed by me to guide groups through the process of making the most vital decisions they face in the process of designing a DAO, soft and hard governance, on and off chain, no matter what platform. The process of exploring the purpose of groups with the canvas yields well defined use cases, powerful educational experiences and high quality dialogue that often leads into action. DAO Design Canvas has been used in all 5 continents and has been used to design the CuraDAO, the dHack DAOs amongst others.",
