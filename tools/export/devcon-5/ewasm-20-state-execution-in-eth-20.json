  "title": "Ewasm 2.0 - State Execution in Eth 2.0",
  "description": "This session aims to bring clarity to what execution on Eth 2.0 means. It will be presented by multiple members of the Ewasm team, starting with a historical overview of how Eth 2.0 designs evolved around execution, followed by deeper technical topics. We will cover: - Scout (an Eth 2.0 execution engine) - Different execution environments (such as the \"Eth1 shard\") - In-depth presentation of different designs used in the Eth 2.0 stateless model - An Eth 2.0 execution testnet If you are interested in stateless contracts and Merkle proofs, this is the session to attend.",
