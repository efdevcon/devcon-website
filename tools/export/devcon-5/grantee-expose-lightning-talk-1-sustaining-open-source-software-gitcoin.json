  "description": "As end-users join us on the journey from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 they will encounter a new suite of tools, terminology, and ways of thinking. The way you architect your app will have massive implications for your users, and developers need to balance the tradeoffs between decentralization and maintaining a good user experience. In this talk, Gitcoin VP of Engineering Dan Lipert will discuss the tools and techniques Web 3.0 developers can use to make their users' lives easier, while still maintaining decentralization and privacy. He'll go over the advantages and disadvantages of tools like decentralizated storage, blockchain metadata caches, running your own nodes, and using public blockchain explorers. As you create your next generation web application, you'll need to decide how to keep your userbase's data safe and private, without sacrificing usability - come to this panel to learn about the tools available to you and how best to utilize them.",
