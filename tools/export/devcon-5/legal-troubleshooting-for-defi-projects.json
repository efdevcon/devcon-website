  "description": "This will be a practical course and discussion around navigating decentralized finance projects through troubled waters of global regulation. It will cover issues universal for many DeFi areas, as well as those specific to most popular products (DEX-es, stablecoins, etc.), in a cross-jurisdictional context. The goal is to cover many topics neglected in mainstream media discussion, yet crucially relevant for DeFi projects creators. Not planned to be a lecture delivered ex cathedra, but an actual workshop for all DeFi movement participants present at devcon.",
