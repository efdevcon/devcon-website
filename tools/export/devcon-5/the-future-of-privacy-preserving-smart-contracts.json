  "title": "The Future of Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts",
  "description": "Ethereum is unable to support the development of privacy-preserving smart contracts in its current state. What do we need from Ethereum 2.0 to build arbitrary privacy-preserving smart contracts? What cryptographic building blocks are required?  We’ll begin by diving into recent efforts both in academia and industry towards building PPSCs and some of the fundamental flaws with these approaches. We’ll also cover the trade-offs that need to be considered and the lessons learned from previous attempts in this space. Furthermore, we will discuss the limitations on use cases for each approach.Attendees of the presentation will leave with a better understanding of the state of the art for PPSCs in Ethereum and the wider blockchain space.",
