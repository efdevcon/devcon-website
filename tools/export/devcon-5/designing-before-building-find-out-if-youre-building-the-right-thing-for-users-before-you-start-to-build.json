  "description": "Blockchain development takes longer than Web2 product iteration cycles. This means teams don’t know if they’re building something users want until after a costly and time consuming development cycle. We use Design Sprints to prototype, test and learn from real user feedback — fast. Bringing product design methodologies to Dapps and DeFi developers. At Deep Work Studio, we've used the Design Sprint process to find out if a product is worth developing, if a feature is worth the effort, or if the value proposition is really valid. With teams from ConsenSys, Molecule, Wyre, Hummingbot, Ramp, Pillar and more. In this talk, we'll talk through the process. Showing how any team can design, prototype and test a product within a few days.  Too often we've seen extensively build products launch to little user or market need. At the end of the talk, teams will have insights on how they can:  - Validate products and features before a costly building phase. - Increase speed to market. - Increase chances of product success. With real user feedback in days not years!",
