  "title": "Simulating Ethereum network with SimBlock",
  "description": "SimBlock is a blockchain network simulator. It was designed as an event-driven simulator wherein each participating node behaves according to generated events, e.g., block generation and exchanging messages. This simulator supports Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin networks and has already been used in several studies about block propagation delay and fork rate. We are developing to support Ethereum, which will allow Ethereum developers or researchers to obtain more realistic data, such as in setting block generation intervals and designing neighbor node selection algorithms. In this presentation, we will show an experiment on how GHOST improves blockchain security as an application of SimBlock. GHOST is a block selection protocol being developed together with Casper, which is PoS protocol of Ethereum. GHOST has been shown analytically to improve blockchain security, but there is little experimental support. In this experiment, we compare the attack success rate in several parameters with the longest protocol.We would like to introduce a practical simulator and get your opinion on future SimBlock Ethereum support.",
