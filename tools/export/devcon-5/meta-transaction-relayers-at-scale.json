  "title": "Meta Transaction Relayers at Scale",
  "description": "Earlier this year Bloom’s smart contracts were consuming over 2% of all gas on Ethereum mainnet. All coming from one meta transaction relayer. In this talk we will cover the techniques implemented in Bloom’s transaction broadcasting service to meet strict requirements of transaction ordering, fee management, chain reorg detection and alerting. We will also cover the challenges of moving a Meta transaction service from test nets with low, consistent volume and quick confirmation times to main net with irregular costs and spiking periods of congestions.We will officially open source the service at Devcon and discuss future work involving how to reliably cache and batch transactions to further reduce meta transaction costs.",
