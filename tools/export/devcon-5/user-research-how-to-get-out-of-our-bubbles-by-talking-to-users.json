  "title": "User Research: How to get out of our bubbles by talking to users",
  "description": "In this workshop targeted at anyone building blockchain products or services, an experienced User Research team will help you step out of your comfort zone; by learning to interview and observe end users. Georgia and Sasha will explain the benefits of doing user research, what it looks and feels like when we talk to people who are different from us, with some \"tales from the trenches\". Then we will help groups 1) identify and find the right users for your research, 2) work out what to ask them 3) practice interviewing people to get to the core insights. Attendees will leave the workshop with a taste for conducting their own future user research, as well as increased confidence to challenge their own biases and blindspots.",
