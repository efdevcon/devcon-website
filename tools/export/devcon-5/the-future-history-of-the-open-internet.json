  "description": "Human communication systems have always ebbed & flowed between being open & closed.  From the founding of the Free Software Foundation in 1985, to the beginnings of the open source movement in the 1990s, to the historic battles between Linux & Microsoft, to the publication of the Bitcoin Whitepaper in 2008, to the rise of Github, Google, Facebook, and Amazon, there is a rich history of progress on open, permissionless, systems.The internet is the most powerful human communication system in history.  The internet changed the world because it allowed humans to move information across a network; and now we have the internet of money: the ability to move financial value across the internet.  What will participation in the internet of money look like?  What will the future history of our era of the internet look like?  In this talk, Gitcoin Founder Kevin Owocki will talk about the history of the open internet + project these trends forward into 2020 and beyond.",
