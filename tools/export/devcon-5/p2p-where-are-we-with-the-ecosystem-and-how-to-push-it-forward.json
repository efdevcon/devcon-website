  "description": "p2p and Ethereum need each other a lot in order to bring decentralized future, but we're not working together very well. Leaders of p2p projects and core blockchain/dapp developers in the same room to build bridges and align plans on day0.Blockchain/dapp people don't know too much about p2p projects and don't have access to p2p stack that they need to build real decentralized applications.Â p2p people can't navigate blockchain ecosystem, don't know what's needed, don't have access to funding.We've set out to fix all of this in 2019. 3 phases:1.p2p Ecosystem report. Directory and assessment of what works right now.2.p2p ecosystem position paper. How to design p2p ecosystem from first principles and how should we get there, what are the priorities for reasearch/funding.3.p2p infrastructure DAO. Experts from both p2p and Ethereum allocating grants together. $400k already committed to grants. This breakout session would briefly present findings of the p2p ecosystem report, but would focus on designing perfect p2p ecosystem that would make deliver everything needed to make Ethereum ecosystem happy. We're also submitting a 20-minute talk proposal \"State of p2p\" where leaders of key p2p projects we would present learnings from this workshop on day1.",
