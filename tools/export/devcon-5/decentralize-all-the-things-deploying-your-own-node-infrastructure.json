  "description": "Many developers rely on third-party node services to make dapp development easier and reduce user onboarding challenges, but this can lead to single points of failure and systemic weaknesses in web3 infrastructure. This presentation will go over some of the weaknesses in different ethereum node implementations and show you how to mitigate against them in your own resilient node service, including how to reduce node start times with efficient state replication and how to protect against DDoS attacks. Reduce your dependence on third parties and make sure your dapp or blockchain-related service can take a beating. Blockscale used these same techniques to help MyCrypto significantly improve the performance and cost-effectiveness of their node services. This presentation includes code examples and deployment demos.",
