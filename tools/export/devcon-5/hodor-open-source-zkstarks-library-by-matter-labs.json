  "description": "\"Hodor\" (let's be original and don't use Marvel Universe) is an open source implementation of zkSTARKs over prime field (initially) that is currently being developed by Matter Labs and expected to be released early-mid September. In this workshop I'd like to cover some information about zkSTARKs such as arithmetization and prover/verifier work, as well as give concrete examples how to use \"Hodor\".",
