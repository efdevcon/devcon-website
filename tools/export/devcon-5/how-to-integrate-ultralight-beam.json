  "title": "How to Integrate Ultralight Beam",
  "description": "The objective of Ultralight Beam (\"UB\") is to provide a simple and extensible messaging format for applications to transmit arbitrary data over a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). MANETs are devices that come together to form a network without relying on any infrastructure. In the context of Ethereum, this allows for transactions to be broadcasted and state channels to be formed, but offline.  This workshop aims to show how a developer could integrate Ultralight Beam into their application to allow for offline interactions as described above.",
