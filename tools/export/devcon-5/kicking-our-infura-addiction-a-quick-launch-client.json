  "description": "How do you connect to mainnet? To minimize effort, there is one obvious answer: Infura. Infura has its place, but using it everywhere means giving up so many of the core promises that Ethereum makes. So how can we make it easier to run your own node and actually deliver on Ethereum's promises? One of the worst parts of starting up your own node from scratch is the launch time. If you're very lucky, you can count launch time in hours. Any less lucky, and you'll be counting in days. In this talk, I explore how to reduce cold-start launch time to minutes. I cover the approach of downloading just the state required to execute the most recent blocks. It requires a new execution strategy, and is significantly accelerated by a supplemental network protocol. I show the progress in a client that I prototyped it in: Trinity.",
