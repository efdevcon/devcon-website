  "description": "The first Augur master plan from 2017 is almost completed, so it's time to look to what's next. To refresh, the original one was:1. Release a v1 which'll be pretty, slow, hard to use, and expensive 2. Integrate 0x and release a v1.5 that allows partially off chain trading so people can create, modify, and cancel orders quickly 3. Integrate Maker once out and release a v2 (“Soros”) 4. Add automatic rollover contracts 5. Release a v3 with super high transactions per second using sharding and/or raiden (“Simons”)In this lightning talk we'll go over what's next!",
