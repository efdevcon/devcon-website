  "title": "State Channels on Ethereum with Counterfactual",
  "description": "State channels are a critical \"layer 2\" scaling technology for ethereum. State channels let users conduct \"off chain\" transactions rapidly, without waiting for blockchain latency, but with each transaction still considered a \"final\" transfer of digital value or other valuable \"state\". However, they are difficult to engineer - today, many dapp developers have had to \"roll their own\" channels. Counterfactual aims to make it easy for developers to use channels in their applications, and get started making secure, scalable, performant ethereum dapps today. This talk will cover: - Overview of state channels technology - Introduction to the Counterfactual framework - How developers can get started using Counterfactual today",
