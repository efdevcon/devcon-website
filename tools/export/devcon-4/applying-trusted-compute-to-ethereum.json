  "title": "Applying Trusted Compute to Ethereum",
  "description": "Explore the role of trusted computation in blockchain and decentralized computing for improving scalability, privacy and security. The breakout will begin with a number of short perspectives on how trusted computation can and should integrate with Ethereum, before shifting to a conversation of what is needed from trusted computation going forward from perspective of decentralization. Participants are members of Enterprise Ethereum Alliance that are working on applying trusted computation to Ethereum broadly. A common implementation of trusted computation is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) which is a secure area of a main processor. Code and data loaded inside the secure area, commonly known as secure enclave, is protected with respect to integrity and confidentiality. Intel SGX, TrustZone, Keystone etc. are examples of such TEEs. 10 companies are committed to support this breakout session.",
