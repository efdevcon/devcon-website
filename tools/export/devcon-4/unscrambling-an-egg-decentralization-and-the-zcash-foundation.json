  "description": "The Zcash protocol we know today started as a project by the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company (commonly known as the \"Zcash Company\"), but it wasn't meant to live under the aegis of a single company. In this talk, the Executive Director of the Zcash Foundation—a separate, independent 501(c)3 from the Zcash Company—will cover the path forward for further decentralizing the Zcash protocol, share lessons from the Zcash Foundation's experience in governance applicable to dapp developers and Ethereum community members, and discuss trade-offs inherent in various approaches for bootstrapping cryptoeconomic systems.",
