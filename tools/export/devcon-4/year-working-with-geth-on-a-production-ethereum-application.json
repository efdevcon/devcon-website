  "description": "AirSwap is a decentralized trading network. As Infura can attest, these applications end up making quite a few calls to Ethereum nodes. Most of the calls areÂ simple lookup calls just checking balances. In addition, because the network supports trading there are many transferring token calls as well. This talk focuses on the evolution of AirSwap's geth infrastructure through the course of the year and how the setup has changed. We started from using Infura, to a single node, to making an in-house cluster. Along the way, we've experienced down times, slow syncs, and code issues. While, the infrastructure is bound to change as the ecosystem shifts, we'd love to share what we've learned and a bit of our setup.",
