  "description": "Etherscan is a block explorer used and loved by many of us. One of the core features of Ethereum is the ability to verify, view, and interact with smart contracts through Etherscan. The problem is that this functionality is mostly closed source and end users have to trust a single entity that this information is valid.With the help of EthPrize (http://ethprize.io/) and the Ethereum Foundation, POA Network has been building an Open Source EVM block explorer to solve this issue. Our v1 release will take place very and soon and we would love the opportunity to show developers and the Ethereum community that there is another option other than Etherscan. Along with the standard blocks, transactions, internal transactions, tokens, and logs, our v1 release will include contract verification, contract read and write functionality, and exportable smart contracts for further verification from developers. Our plan is to support Ethereum, Kovan, Rinkeby, Ropsten, POA Network, and Sokol testnet in our first release. We've had the great opportunity to work with many developers in the space to build an open and accessible block explorer for the Ethereum community. Here is more info on the project: https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-explorer",
