  "title": "Improving the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM 1.0, 1.5, 2.0)",
  "description": "This panel will consist of experts with deep experience designing and building both the current iteration of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, EVM 1.0, as well as various candidates for future virtual machines including EVM 1.5 (several improvements to the existing EVM) and Ewasm (a reimagining of the Ethereum Virtual Machine built using industry-standard WebAssembly technology). These experts will discuss the history and current state of EVM 1.0, the various improvement proposals that are on the table, and the various initiatives underway today. It will also touch upon harder, more controversial questions regarding the EVM 1.5 and EVM 2.0 (Ewasm)Â proposals. The panel will give audience members an opportunity to learn about how and why Ethereum and its smart contracts work the way they do today, to ask questions of the experts behind this design, and to participate in the conversation about the future of Ethereum--both the low-level virtual machine and the stack of developer tooling (such as Solidity) built on top of it.",
