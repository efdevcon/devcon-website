  "title": "Contributing to Ethereum and Open-Source",
  "description": "The Ethereum community is an open source community. We rely on implementations of an open protocol, open tools built to interface with these implementations, and ultimately open source dApps and contracts that live on top. Without a healthy ecosystem of open source developers, Ethereum is nothing. That said, contributing to open source can sometimes feel intimidating, and it's not always clear how to get started. Fortunately, it is actually easy in the Ethereum community! Everything is growing and changing so much. There is so much to do and to build, and there are a ton of great ways to get started. This talk will help demystify contributing to Ethereum and open-source in general.",
