  "description": "If we’re honest about what we claim we want to achieve—banking the unbanked and censorship resistance commerce for common folks—then we shouldn’t be surprised when the first people that actually use crypto are those for whom banking and censorship are important, daily problems. Besides rogue states, drug dealers, and the impoverished, sex workers stand out as the next major group to adopt crypto to use in their daily lives. I believe we should embrace this community and build our dapps with them in mind. In this talk I want to discuss: Cultural parallels between the crypto and sex worker communities, Trust but verify - Escorts screen clients before the first meeting, Self-sovereignty, Crypto - we don’t want anyone to be able to get in the way of how we spend our money, Sex workers - we don’t want anyone to be able get in the way of how we use our bodies, Privacy - Fake identities / Protonmail / Cash, Challenges that sex workers face and blockchain-based solutions, Lack of banking access, Difficulty advertising, Rent-seeking intermediaries (pimps), Cancellations, The case for sex work decriminalization, The opportunity for Ethereum to welcome the sex worker community",
