  "description": "Every moment, servers are logging, cataloging, and selling your personal, private information. Your utility bill payments, cell phone records, insurance payments, auto history, court records, credit score, identity information, social security records, address history and hundreds of other pieces of information are amassed into giant data warehouses where it’s packaged and sold to data farms, lenders, and banks. A Blockchain Solution: The data industry is a murky one. With the right direction, businesses are ready to adopt Blockchain technology TODAY as Blockchain can offer practical solutions to GDPR and Data privacy. Riddled with scams, dark markets, and illegal underground sources of data, the problem is getting worse. 10,000+ different companies report information about you to major bureaus. Analysts’ figures show that number climbing to more than 30,000 in the next 10 years. This is where Blockchain is needed. Developing the Future: In the past, consumers had little recourse, calling central data collection firms are a “necessary evil”. Blockchain gives users the power to own their own data, and decide how it’s used, how it’s sold. How you can develop systems that get adoption today? What businesses are ready to integrate now? Simple solutions to big problems.",
