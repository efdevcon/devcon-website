  "description": "This talk will give an introduction to Yul, the intermediate language developed by the Solidity team. We'll go through the motivation, design decisions and progress of implementation. Yul is designed to have multiple targets, EVM and ewasm, and support multiple languages as a frontend. We'll touch on languages using it (Flint, LLL) and what is ahead in order to support it in Solidity.",
