  "description": "Sharding and Casper promise to greatly improve performance, sustainability, and security of the Ethereum blockchain. Alongside a novel and much-discussed consensus protocol, they also entail fundamental changes to the requirements and constraints imposed on the peer-to-peer (p2p) networking layer. In this talk we report on ongoing research as well as the current implementation state of the latter. We begin by defining key qualitative and quantative properties the network should have. Then we discuss several options for both node discovery and gossip protocols, comparing their performance on the basis of simulationresults. Finally, we give an update on the current state and future developments of protocol implementations.",
