  "title": "Build and Operate Internet-Scale Ethereum dApps on Celer Network",
  "description": "Current Ethereum dApps have low throughput because each operation needs to be processed by the vast majority of nodes to reach on-chain consensus. Off-chain scaling techniques such as state channel are able to support truly scale-out dApps with better privacy and no compromise on the trust-free guarantee. Despite its high potentials, off-chain scaling is still in its infancy with challenges remaining unsolved. For example, how to construct state channels that support arbitrary state transitions with minimal on-chain operations? How to route payments to achieve high throughput in an off-chain network that is fundamentally different from data networks? How to help developers to easily build and operate scalable off-chain dApps? How to guarantee that off-chain states are always available for possible disputes? In this talk, we will describe how Celer Network meets these challenges. Celer embraces a layered architecture with clean abstractions that enable rapid evolution of each individual component, including generalized state channels that supports fast and generic off-chain state transitions; a provably optimal payment routing algorithm that achieves orders of magnitude higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art solutions; a powerful development framework and runtime for off-chain dApps; and an incentive-aligned mechanism that provides stable liquidity and high off-chain state availability.",
