  "description": "In 2017, I presented the ideas behind the Moon Project, which aims to create a blazingly fast and secure decentralized browser for DApps. In this talk, I'll highlight advancements towards this goal, highlighting Formality, a massively parallel programming language featuring formal proofs and smart contracts, and the FVM, a decentralized virtual machine dedicated to running functional programs with much lower gas costs using the so-called Abstract Algorithm.",
