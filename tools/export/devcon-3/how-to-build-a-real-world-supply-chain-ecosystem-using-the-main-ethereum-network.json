  "description": "We are building a platform for the Italian Ministry of Agricolture to track wine supply chain on the Main Ethereum Network. The platform is integrated with existing systems of the Ministry and, on a volutary basis, wine producers can legally certificate the traceability of all production steps, in fact replacing the current national certification system. Customers can always verify the authenticity of the production history scanning an NFC tag on the bottle with a dedicated mobile app. In this speech we will explain the platform architecture details and how we managed to solve all the legal, process and integration issues that such a kind of project implies.",
