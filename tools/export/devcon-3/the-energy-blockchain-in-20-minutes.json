  "title": "The Energy Blockchain in 20 Minutes",
  "description": "An overview of the energy blockchain landscape detailing the tech that is being built to accommodate energy data oracles + real world device interactions. What have we learned from using this technology on mission critical infrastructure where lives can be lost if decimals are out of place? Transmission lines can be blown and millions of $ in expenses for what would be an accounting error in financial applications? And most importantly, we will go over the grand vision of every energy consumption + production node on a network being a smart agent enabling next-day prediction of by-minute energy consumption so we can generate exactly 100% of our needs, no more.",
