  "title": "0x: an open protocol for trustless, low friction exchange of ERC20 tokens",
  "description": "In the two years that have passed since the Ethereum blockchainâ€™s genesis block, numerous decentralized applications (dApps) have created Ethereum smart contracts for peer-to-peer exchange. Rapid iteration and a lack of best practices have left the blockchain scattered with proprietary and application-specific implementations. As a result, end users are exposed to numerous smart contracts of varying quality and security, with unique configuration processes and learning curves, all of which implement the same functionality. This approach imposes unnecessary costs on the network by fragmenting end users according to the particular dApp each user happens to be using, destroying valuable network effects around liquidity. We present 0x: an open protocol and shared settlement layer for trustless, low friction exchange of ERC20 tokens.",
