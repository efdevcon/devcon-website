  "title": "The Open Vote Network: Decentralised Internet Voting as a Smart Contract",
  "description": "The Open Vote Network (OV-net) is a self-tallying (and self-enforcing) e-voting protocol i.e. there are no tallying authorities – anyone can count the votes. It is also the first extensive cryptographic protocol to be implemented as a smart contract (i.e. zero knowledge proofs) that *can work* on Ethereum’s official network today. I’d like to present the protocol, the technical difficulties I faced while building it (and the gas costs before/after hardfork if feasible), and the beauty of combining both cryptographic protocols and smart contracts.",
