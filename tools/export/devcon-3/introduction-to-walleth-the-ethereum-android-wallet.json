  "title": "Introduction to WALLETH â€“ the Ethereum Android Wallet",
  "description": "Devices that run Android are now often one (if not even the only) computer for a lot users to access many services currently. So to bring Ethereum to the masses and replace current services we need good clients for this platform. WALLETH aims to fill some of this gap. Here I will talk about the concepts behind the user-interface and general ideas behind the project. Another area that I want to shed some light on in this talk is the special security properties mobile applications on Android have. We will not have time for much more in this talk but there is also one 30min deep-dive session later in the conference.",
