  "title": "Pluggable crypto for Ethereum nodes: Masterchain experience",
  "description": "Ethereum has a few subsystems which use cryptography in their core functionality: 1. Transaction processing system, 2. P2P node communication, 3. EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), 4. Mining. So far all these systems use only one crypto library but they use it in different ways. We have developed an extra crypto-layer, which makes crypto to work as an additional abstract layer. The extra-crypto layer is completely transparent for all ethereum logic. It allows to switch crypto-algorithms to use in Ethereum.",
