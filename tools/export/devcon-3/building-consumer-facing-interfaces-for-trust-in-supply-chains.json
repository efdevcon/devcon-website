  "title": "Building Consumer Facing Interfaces for Trust in Supply Chains",
  "description": "Provenance is building a platform to make consumer product supply chains more transparent. Taking advantage of Ethereum and IPFS, we’ve been iterating through a number of pilots in different industries, from organic bacon to fair-trade coconuts to enable a simple shared and trusted way to share the proven claims behind our products e.g. organic or proof of payment of fair wages, and link that to the flow of batches of product. Throughout this journey, we have learnt a lot about industry needs, working with both small and large retailers and brands. We’ve also forged partnerships with sustainability standards e.g Soil Association organic and other data systems that we can connect to enable verification of claims and inputs for our Ethereum based app e.g. Sourcemap. User centred design is core to the work at Provenance – exploring how we can make blockchain backed data appear differently on the frontend and provide accessible links to inspect the chain. As a social enterprise largely built through grant funding and with the support of academia we are keen to share our learnings with the developer community and gauge interest in forming a group around the development of blockchain backed interfaces for trusted data sets.",
