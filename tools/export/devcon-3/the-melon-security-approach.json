  "description": "Melonport is striving to build a vibrant and successful developer ecosystem of Melon module builders. An important part of that ecosystem is the security and behaviour of smart contracts that make up Melon modules as well as how they interact with the Melon core and each other. In this presentation, weâ€™ll demonstrate our ongoing technical efforts to assist Melon module developers in creating safe, secure smart contracts and touch on the importance of getting the auditing process right and how others can learn from our experience.",
