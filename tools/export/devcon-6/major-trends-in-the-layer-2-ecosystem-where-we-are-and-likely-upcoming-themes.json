  "description": "The Layer 2 space moves at lightning speed. Just as we start to grasp a particular concept or protocol, changes and new ideas flood the ecosystem. It is exciting and fast-paced, but it can be difficult to maintain an accurate birds' eye view of current developments and upcoming themes. This lightning talk will quickly survey the Layer 2 field and make some predictions around what themes we are likely to see in the coming months.",
