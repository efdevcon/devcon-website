  "title": "Building an End-to-End EVM Symbolic Execution Engine in Solidity",
  "description": "Symbolic execution is a widely used approach to formally verify/analyze EVM bytecode. But what exactly is it? What are constraints, and solvers?? Why do you need symbols anyway?? In this talk we will go through a symbolic execution engine for EVM bytecode fully written in Solidity, hopefully demonstrating how beautiful and simple these techniques are, and incentivizing developers to contribute to or write their own formal methods tools.",
