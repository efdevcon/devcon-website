  "title": "Challenges of Parallelizability under Ethereum's Execution Model",
  "description": "We highlight two challenges of parallel execution on Ethereum: 1. Historical data shows that data dependencies force us to execute a large portion of transactions serially. 2. If we assign incentives to scheduling decisions, this might introduce non-determinism that the system cannot tolerate. In this lightning talk, we present these two problems and outline some proposed solutions. Note that this work was accepted for and presented at ICSE'22 (https://bit.ly/3HzPKZT)",
