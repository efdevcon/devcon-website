  "description": "The talk will give an exhaustive overview of the different AMM algorithms currently deployed on major distributed ledgers, as well as the underlying intuition behind their design. Building up from the basic principles of AMM design, the talk will then cover the algorithmic mechanisms used in the various different algorithms including Constant Sum, Constant Product (Uniswap V2), Uniswap V3, KyberSwap, StableSwap (Curve), CryptoSwap (Curve V2), Solidly Stable pairs, Clipper, Dodo, and RFQ systems.",
