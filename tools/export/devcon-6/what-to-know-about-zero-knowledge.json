  "title": "What to know about Zero Knowledge",
  "description": "Zero Knowledge, aka ZK, has become a catch-all term to represent much of \"modern\" or \"advanced\" cryptography -- especially cryptography that's relevant to the future of blockchains.  In this panel, we will share our perspectives on ZK -- how to think about it, what to look out for, and what to focus in on. We'll also discuss how ZK may alter and complement Ethereum's own future.",
