  "title": "Future-block MEV in Proof of Stake",
  "description": "In PoS Ethereum, block proposers are known ahead of time. This allows for new types of MEV, which leverage the ownership of future block space. Using this, some attacks that were expensive due to arbitrage competition, such as oracle manipulations, become very cheap. There could also be opportunities for incentivizing high-MEV transactions in a future block that you know you will control.",
