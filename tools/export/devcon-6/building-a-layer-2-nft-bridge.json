  "description": "Cross-chain communication is one of the most complex and interesting parts of multi-chain development. In this workshop we’ll build out an NFT bridge from the ground up between Ethereum and Arbitrum covering all you need to know about bridging design and cross chain messaging. You’ll walk out with a set of smart contracts you can use to bridge your mainnet NFT collection along with way more than you ever wanted to know about bridging.",
