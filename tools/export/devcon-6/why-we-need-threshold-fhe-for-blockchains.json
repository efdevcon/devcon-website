  "description": "There is a fundamental limit to building privacy-preserving applications in ZK. For example, we do not know how to replicate applications such as Uniswap and Aave in zero knowledge where complete privacy for users is achieved. This talk introduces how threshold FHE can help fill the gap ZK tech leave us desiring--privacy for shared-state applications.",
