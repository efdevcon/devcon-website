  "description": "We often rely too much on our instincts about how our product work or prior knowledge on how it should be read. More often than not, we are wrong. Newcomers will always use your app in the \"wrong\" manner and talking to them will reveal many ways in which you can improve your product. I've worked many years in many web3 projects, from the Ethereum Foundation Wallet, to ENS and specially a full year at the Defi protocol Balancer as a User Researcher. I would love to share what I've learned.",
