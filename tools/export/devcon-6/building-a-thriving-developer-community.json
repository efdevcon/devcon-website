  "description": "I want to give a talk on the ins and outs of building a thriving web3 developer community. I help lead DevX at https://superfluid.finance and I've learned the hard way what it takes to get hundreds of projects built on your protocol.  I'll give an overview of what both engineers and marketing/growth people get wrong about building a developer ecosystem, how we run hackathons, and how we've productized our docs and developer tooling.",
