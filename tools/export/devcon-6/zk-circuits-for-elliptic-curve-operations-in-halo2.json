  "title": "ZK Circuits for Elliptic Curve Operations in Halo2",
  "description": "We present halo2-ecc, a ZK circuit library for elliptic curve operations in halo2. Our library implements multi-scalar multiplication, optimal Ate pairing, and ECDSA verification on curves including BN254 and Secp256k1. We will show benchmarks for these operations as well as applications to recursion and aggregation of halo2 proofs. This is joint work with Jonathan Wang.",
