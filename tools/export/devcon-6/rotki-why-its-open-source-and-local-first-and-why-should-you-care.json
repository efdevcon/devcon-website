  "title": "Rotki: Why itâ€™s Open Source and Local-First and Why Should You Care?",
  "description": "This will be a talk on the why we need opensource, local-first privacy preserving tools in this field.  Reiterate the benefits of opensource and the cypherphunk ethos that built the crypto field. Ponder why so many people still develop closed source centralized tools and explain why this is contrary to the core ethos of the field. Then by using rotki as a main example show how things can and should be done differently. The opensource, local-first way. Explore both benefits and drawbacks",
