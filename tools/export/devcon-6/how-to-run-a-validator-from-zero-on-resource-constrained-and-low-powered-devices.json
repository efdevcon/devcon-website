  "title": "How to Run a Validator From Zero on Resource-Constrained and Low Powered Devices",
  "description": "Our main goal is to contribute to the network decentralization by making it easier and affordable for regular users to run nodes (and staking) on resource-constrained devices as well as helping to test the next major Ethereum upgrade (The Merge).\nIn this workshop we will show from scratch how to install and set up an Ethereum validator node, from running the Execution Layer + Consensus Layer combo to creating the keys and setup for the validator in order to get it up and running.",
