  "description": "According to Gemini's 2022 Global State of Crypto Report, women in developing countries lead in the adoption of crypto among women. Particularly, women in Latina America lead in crypto ownership when compared to other regions, with 43% of crypto holders being women. We'll take a real world lens to the reality of LATAM and the need to scale Ethereum, the status of L2s, emerging modular blockchains, and how they all fit into the end goal of getting Ethereum transactions into fractions of cents.",
