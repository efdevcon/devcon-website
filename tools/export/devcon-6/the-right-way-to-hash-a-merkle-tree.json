  "title": "The Right Way to Hash a Merkle Tree",
  "description": "We shill an assembly SHA256 library that is optimized to compute the hash tree root of a Merkle tree. It consists of reusing two publicly available methods: 1. Hardcoding padding block. This method is used in Bitcoin's core client hashing algo.  2. Use CPU-vectorization to hash different branches in parallell. This is Intel's \"multi-buffer\" method.  Initial benchmarks show up to 1200% improvement on hashing of large lists on AVX512.  A GoAssembly version is used by prysm.",
