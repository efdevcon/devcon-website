  "description": "The proof of stake Ethereum specs are designed to encourage decentralization by punishing centralization.  In this session, we will discuss how to design Distributed Validator Technology in a way that minimizes correlation risk by using design choices across distributed key generation, middleware, networking topology, and versioning. We'll also describe why creating a trust-minimized, non-custodial, and non-correlated architecture is the most healthy way to enable multi-operator staking.",
