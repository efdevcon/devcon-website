  "title": "A Mechanism for Pricing Non-fungible Resources: Toward Multi-dimensional Fee Markets",
  "description": "We propose a new mechanism for multi-dimensional resource pricing in blockchains. Currently, many blockchain systems operate with either fixed transaction fees or fixed relative prices of different resources (e.g., compute, memory, storage). Our proposed mechanism prices resources independently and automatically in a way that maximizes some utility set by the protocol designer.",
