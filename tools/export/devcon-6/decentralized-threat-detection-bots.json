  "title": "Decentralized Threat Detection Bots",
  "description": "Decentralized threat detection bots are a recent area of research and development for protecting the ecosystem. This talk will cover concepts and recent research on detection bots and implementation patterns including heuristic-based, time-series based, multi-block, and TX simulation. Examples involving prior exploits will be included, as well as tools, limitations, the potential for automated threat prevention, and areas for further research.",
