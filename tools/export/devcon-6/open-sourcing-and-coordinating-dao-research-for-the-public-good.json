  "title": "Open Sourcing and Coordinating DAO Research for the Public Good",
  "description": "DAOs are cutting-edge organizational structures and there is limited precedent to help DAO stakeholders understand how to operate. DAOs are now starting to research legal, governance, treasury management, tax, and other issues, but much of the foundational learnings of DAO stakeholders are siloed within their own communities. My talk would focus on how we as a community coordinate, procure, and open-source research foundational to DAO operations to more effectively scale the industry.",
