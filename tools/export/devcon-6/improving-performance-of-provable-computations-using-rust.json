  "description": "We reimplemented the Cairo VM in Rust to increase its performance. We will show an MVP that is between 10 and 100 times faster than the previous Python implementation. Executing a program with this VM outputs a trace which can later be used to generate a Proof of the program's execution. Combining Zero Knowledge Proofs with Rollups allow us to have scalability without compromising the security of blockchains.",
