  "description": "As a nascent field, cryptoeconomics is still lacking in terms of formal definitions upon which a cohesive theoretical edifice can be built. Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) is a particular example of a technical concept where there is no widely agreed upon formalization. Here, we discuss the difficulties in arriving to such a formulation, and survey some proposals. Critically, we emphasize what MEV is *not*, highlighting the critical aspects that need to be encompassed in its definition.",
