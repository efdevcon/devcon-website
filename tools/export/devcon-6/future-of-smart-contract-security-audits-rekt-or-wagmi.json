  "title": "Future of Smart Contract Security Audits: REKT or WAGMI?",
  "description": "Smart contract security audits have become a de facto requirement for Ethereum applications. However, there continue to be multi-million dollar hacks every week highlighting significant challenges with audits such as questionable quality, arguable effectiveness, unreasonable expectations, high cost, low availability and dearth of talent. This panel proposes to debate on these contentious aspects with some leaders in this space and peek into their crystal ball to see if we are REKT or WAGMI.",
