  "description": "With the wider adoption, the use of open blockchains and dapps built on top of it is becoming progressively regulated by governments all over the world (especially in the EU and the U.S.). Understanding and adjusting to these regulations is becoming a reality for many projects in the ecosystem, especially the ones facing the users and the community. What will be the impact of regulation on the Ethereum ecosystem and how it might change the existing use cases, designs and utilities?",
