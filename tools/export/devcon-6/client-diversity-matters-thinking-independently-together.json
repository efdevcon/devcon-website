  "description": "There is an ongoing conversation about the increased centralization of the Ethereum ecosystem following the migration to Proof of Stake. Clients deployed, nodes location, hosting services as well as liquid staking providers that have significant relevance that could potentially reduce the resilience of the network as a whole.
