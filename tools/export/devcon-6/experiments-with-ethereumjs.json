  "description": "The idea of the workshop is to present the EthereumJS stack and then help people to set up a local EthereumJS experimentation environment. We will demonstrate how how our packages can be used for research, testing and experimentation and will then let people experiment on their own (or in small groups), for example by activating one of the newer EIPs and testing blocks/tx, or even running our experimental client.",
