  "description": "We are seeing the emergence of a specialized role on the Ethereum network dedicated to assembling the contents of each block as the ecosystem grows and the impact of \"maximum extractable value\" (MEV) becomes clear. This talk investigates block building after the Merge and what considerations the move to proof-of-stake brings to the process along with what norms we should strive for to avoid dangerous centralization pressures while maximizing validator profits.",
