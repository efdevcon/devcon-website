  "description": "Rollups are the go-to solution to scaling Ethereum and at the heart of the Ethereum roadmap. Programmable rollups and zk-evms have gathered a lot of attention and research interest. Provers in particular, which produce cryptographic proofs of evm execution, pose challenging problems both theoretically and practically. In this talk we will present our arithmetization and proving scheme, and demo the zk-evm under development at ConsenSys, providing an EVM bytecode compatible end to end solution.",
