description: "With a year of Ethereum development and 15+ years of traditional web/game/infrastructure knowledge, my goal is to provide a developer toolset and examples to drive mass Ethereum adoption through lowering the barrier to entry. I love the #buidl community and I try to supplement the ecosystem whenever I can. If I find something that seems difficult or undocumented, I try to jump in and figure it out so others can have a better understanding. I also love building decentralized games in my free time :) Check out all my projects at: https://austingriffith.com or hit me up @austingriffith"
