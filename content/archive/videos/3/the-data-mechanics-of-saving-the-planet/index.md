title: "The Data Mechanics of Saving the Planet"
description: "This talk gives a first-hand account of a joint field research project by Terra Genesis International and Streamr. We present a technical report from an Ecuadorean cocoa plantation on how to collect real-time carbon sequestration data from IoT sensors and drone soil sampling, and how to transmit it securely to Ethereum smart contracts via a decentralized peer-to-peer data transport layer. We will share the scientific underpinnings with the audience, demonstrate the potential of the project in helping reverse global warming, discuss the use of automated drone technology for sensor distribution and sample collection, and visualize the methodology for solving connectivity and data collection issues in an important real-life use case."
