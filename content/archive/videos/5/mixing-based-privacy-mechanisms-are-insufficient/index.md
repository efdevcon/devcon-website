description: "Mixing based privacy-preserving mechanisms like trustless coinjoin used by Wasabi wallet and ring signatures used by Monero are noble and might work for the average Joe, but they don't provide privacy required for mission-critical things. The talk will briefly cover some of the attack vectors against such mechanisms and provide tips on improving your privacy within such systems."
