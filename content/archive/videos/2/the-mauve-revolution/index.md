description: "Proof of stake and sharding present two of the biggest upcoming milestones in the ongoing development of the Ethereum protocol. Proof of stake offers the promise to greatly reduce the cost of consensus and increase security guarantees, while sharding presents an approach to allow on-chain scaling to tens of thousands of transactions per second while still retaining a network that can, if needed, run on nothing but a sufficiently large set of consumer laptops. The Casper approach to proof of stake also introduces a number of novel concepts, including consensus-by-bet and fork choice by value-at-loss."
