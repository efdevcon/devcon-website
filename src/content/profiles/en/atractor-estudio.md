Colombian electronic arts collective Atractor understands technology as a field of struggle from their Latin American context. In this scenario, assimilating and experiencing technology always as active users implies that electronic arts and creation have the power to spark conversations and create spaces for community dialogue

For DEVCON they will be performing a video game live performance **The Migrants** and launch their NFT Botánica Transgénica."
