description: "Alex Stokes is a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation who believes deeply in the Ethereum vision. To achieve this vision, he has been working on scaling R&D to make the core protocol more secure and accessible to everyone. This includes tooling and testing work for the Merge, exploratory prototyping for sharding work like EIP-4844 and EIP-4895 to enable validator withdrawals after the Merge. When he is not working on Ethereum, you can find him at the nearest mountaintop."
