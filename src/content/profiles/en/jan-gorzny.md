description: "I'm the Head of L2 Scaling at Quantstamp. I have been interested in scaling solutions since Lightning was discussed and the Plasma white paper was written. I'm particularly interested in making sure these systems are as secure as they are scalable, and I have looked over several such systems during my time at Quantstamp. I also have a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo, where I studied graph algorithms. Other research interests include formal methods and complexity theory."
