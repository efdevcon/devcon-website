category: location

Below are a few of the popular dishes, but one can expect most of the food found in Bogota to be typical Latin American dishes, surrounded by lots of fresh produce.

- Arepas, circular corn cakes, are a Colombian diet staple found throughout the city.
- Many main course dishes consist of octopus, shrimp, or other seafood.
- Ajiaco is a common hearty soup made with chicken, potatoes, and corn on the cob
- Empanadas are common breakfast items/snacks.
- Tamales! Need we say more?
- Hot chocolate, which is an absolute necessity in the lives of the locals, is served alongside a plate of cheese that can then be dipped into the beverage – causing it to melt.
- Despite the large amount of coffee Colombia exports, specialty coffee shops are relatively new in Bogota and lucky for us, on the rise!
