Though we are happy to see the overall situation improving, we are actively monitoring it and taking on-site measures to ensure safety throughout the event. To be accomodating of the situation and its impact on everyone, we are offering a special refund policy for Devcon 6: at any time, for any reason, if you would like to request a full refund (minus applicable taxes and fees), we will respect the request.
