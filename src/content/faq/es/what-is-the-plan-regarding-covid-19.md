Our team has been actively monitoring the COVID-19 situation, both in Colombia and around the world. We’re keeping a keen eye on the number of cases, rate of vaccinations, and projected trends, and we’re staying optimistic that we’ll be able to meet in-person in Bogota for Devcon soon™.

In the meantime, our venue Agora Bogota [has qualified for Bureau Veritas Safe Guard certification](https://agora-bogota.com/en/protocolos-bioseguridad), meaning they have satisfied a rigorous set of biosafety criteria operationally and in their physical space.

As the global situation continues to improve, our team will actively monitor and provide updated plans to our [Devcon Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/category/devcon/), [@EFDevcon Twitter](https://twitter.com/EFDevcon), and [Devcon.org](https://devcon.org). Stay tuned for more!
