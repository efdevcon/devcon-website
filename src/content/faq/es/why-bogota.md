In Bogota, we found the seeds for an ambitious community that our ecosystem could help grow. From builders, to educational entities, local business, industry leaders and more, we’re excited to meet and to work with those making real-world use of Ethereum’s technology locally, and to further those efforts.

In addition to the potential to grow a community, the venue (described above) is located just minutes from hotels, and from both Bogota’s El Dorado International Airport, and the historic Santa Fe and Candelaria neighborhoods. The fully-modern conference center is built to handle everything that Devcon requires, from catering, to WiFi, meeting-space and more.

Our search for a fitting Devcon 6 location began prior to Devcon 5. After exploring venues in over ten cities across the world, and meticulously evaluating each against an extensive set of criteria, the clear winner was Bogota, Colombia.

This process has been long and somewhat delicate given the complicated year that we’ve all had, but we are excited and confident for Devcon 6 in Bogota.
