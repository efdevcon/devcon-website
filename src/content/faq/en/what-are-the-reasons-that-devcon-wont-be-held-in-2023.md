title: What are the reasons that Devcon won't be held in 2023?
category: general
---
We thought long and hard about making this decision. Here’s why:

1. More Impact 🌏

We aim to create the same impact on the Road to Devcon 7 in SEA as in LatAm.

We’ll give time for the booming local Ethereum communities to grow & see new grassroots communities unfold. 🌱

2. Greater Significance 💥

Devcon VI in Bogotá set the bar high. Scheduling Devcon 7 for 2024 gives us time to advance & improve projects, make it a top-notch event, be more accessible for people to plan and budget for international travel. ✈️

3. Embracing Subtraction 🤲

More Ethereum events & communities are surfacing than ever before. [Aya's talk](<https://archive.devcon.org/archive/watch/6/opening-ceremonies-aya/?playlist=Staff Picks&tab=Swarm>) about the Ethereum Foundation's *Subtraction* mindset encourages us to subtract so that ***you*** can add. We want to give room & space for local community events to grow further.
