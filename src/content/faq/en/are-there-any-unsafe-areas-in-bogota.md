Bogota is safer today than at any point in the last 50 years in terms of crime rates. That said, like in Paris, New York City, or any other metropolis, we recommend exercising caution when walking around downtown.

Historic and popular areas, all of which are generally in the center and north of the center, are the safest regions. We’ll also help to guide attendees toward the right spots at the right time of day, for example: younger areas that are ripe with nightlife are better after dark, while the historic center is best to frequent during daylight hours.

The local expression in Bogota is: “No des papaya,” or “Don’t give a papaya.” It essentially means, don’t make yourself a target: use common sense while in Bogota. That means look where you’re going, don’t walk around with your phone out and your bags unzipped, or wear flashy items like expensive watches or gold-plated hardware wallets. With a little bit of common sense and precaution , you can expect to have a fun and safe experience in Bogota.
