Don’t see an event near you on [this community list](https://twitter.com/NathanSexer/status/1600090527101116417?s=20)?
Reach out to support@devcon.org, and let’s try to make it happen. 

If you are interested in organizing an event to strengthen your community's builder ecosystem, consider sending a [sponsorship application](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/applicants/small-grants) to ESP!
