    "description": "Indexing protocols like The Graph and Dune analytics are great for getting insights on application-specific protocols. However, most are used strategic planning rather than being directly actionable. This workshop teaches developers how to make these insights actionable, by building simple programs in 3 steps:\r\n\r\n1. Fetching indexed data streams from public data providers\r\n2. Passing streams through models to generate signals\r\n3. Generating and submitting transactions based on those signals",

Horizontal scaling solves these issues, but doesn't allow atomic composability. In this talk, we review approaches to horizontal scalability & ways to get as close to atomic composability as possible.",
