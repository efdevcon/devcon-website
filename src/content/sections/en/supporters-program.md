  The Devcon Supporters Program recognizes recent contributors to
  Ethereum-Related Public Goods.


  Stakeholders from leading participants across industries have lent their overwhelming support to Ethereum.


  We introduced this program in lieu of traditional sponsorships, and those teams that participated deserve special thanks for their contributions to Ethereum-related public goods funding, includingthe [ETHColombia Quadratic Funding Round @ Devcon](https://ethcolombia.clr.fund/), [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/), [CLR.Fundâ€™s open grants](https://clr.fund/), and the [Protocol Guild](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (which supported core Ethereum research and development).
right: "**Our team owes a big thank you to those teams and DAOs that joined our
  first-ever Supporter Program this year without most benefits expected by
  sponsors. Their support of the Ethereum ecosystem came without things like
  reserved seating, most branding, speaker slots, named event areas and other
  traditional sponsor-like benefits. EF will also proudly be contributing toward
  these efforts.**"
