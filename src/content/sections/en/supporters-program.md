  The Devcon Supporters Program recognizes recent contributors to Ethereum-Related Public Goods.


  Stakeholders from leading participants across industries have lent their overwhelming support to Ethereum.


  We introduced this program in lieu of traditional sponsorships, and those teams that participated deserve special thanks for their contributions to the [ETHColombia Quadratic Funding Round @ Devcon](https://ethcolombia.clr.fund/), to [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/), [CLR.Fund’s open grants](https://clr.fund/), and to the [Protocol Guild](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (which supported core Ethereum research and development).

  **Our team owes a big thank you to those teams and DAOs that joined our first-ever Supporter Program this year without most benefits expected by sponsors. Their support of the Ethereum ecosystem came without things like reserved seating, most branding, speaker slots, named event areas and other traditional sponsor-like benefits. EF will also proudly be contributing toward these efforts.**
