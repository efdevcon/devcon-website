## Devcon After Dark

For the first time in Devcon history, we are keeping the venue **open late**. Instead of ushering all attendees out of the building at 5PM sharp, we are leaving the venue open **until 11PM** to provide a space for continued collaboration, live music, game nights, a Happy Hour each day from 6-8 PM & more! \
