title: Devcon After Dark
left: >-
  For the first time in Devcon history, we are keeping the venue open late.  Instead of ushering all attendees out of the building at 5PM sharp, we are leaving the venue open until 11PM to provide a space for continued collaboration, live music, game nights, a Happy Hour each day from 6-8 PM & more!
