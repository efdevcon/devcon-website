title: Hacker Basement
---
Looking for a place where you can code and learn? This time, we got you covered!

*The hacker basement will be your high-focus zone away from the busy conference ado.*

*It sets the right conditions for an individual to test new stuff on their laptop, to learn, or to hack on new ideas in a group.*

*Everything a hacker needs will be taken care of: cozy seating, electricity, internet and, of course, cyberpunk lighting and low-fi beats to get you in the right mood to build!*

A dedicated space with big screen, chairs, and gamer vibes for zk-gaming, hangout, and more. Expect a Dark Forest game night, MUD events, LAN parties, and more! Want to use the space?
