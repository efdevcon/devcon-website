We couldn't be more excited to announce that Devcon 7 will be coming to Southeast Asia in 2024! 

🌏 Devcon 7 in Southeast Asia offers the opportunity to give a large, new, active, and diverse community a platform on the world Ethereum stage!
💗 By bringing Devcon to SEA we’ll reach more local Ethereum communities & aim to increase diversity within the Ethereum community.

Read the full announcement with details about why Devcon 7 is scheduled for 2024 in South East Asia in the [blog post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/02/28/devcon-7-update/).

BTW, we are still evaluating specific locations within Southeast Asia, and we are re-opening the Forum to give some [extra time for other Southeast Asia communities to propose their cities](https://forum.devcon.org/c/devcon-7-location-suggestions/14). **The deadline for suggestions is March 15, 2023!**
