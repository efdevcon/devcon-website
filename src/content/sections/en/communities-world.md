  We could host Devcon in the same place every year, sure! But we’re working
  toward achieving a goal of bringing Ethereum to communities around the world,
  and to places where it can have real impact **today**. 


  *“The difference between Argentina and some of the wealthier countries is that in wealthier places, there are people who are excited about crypto ideas and theory, but people here deeply understand that crypto is solving real problems.”* 

  **— Vitalik Buterin**
right: Ethereum isn’t merely a technical solution, but a community. While
  blockchain communities in Europe and North America are already strong and
  vivid, we can have a big impact today in newly developing communities.
