  We could host Devcon in the same place every year, sure! But we’re working
  toward achieving a goal of bringing Ethereum to communities around the world,
  and to places where it can have real impact **today**.

  Ethereum isn’t merely a technical solution, but a community. While blockchain
  communities in Europe and North America are already strong and vivid, we can
  have a big impact today in newly developing communities.


  Over the past years, we’ve seen [young Ethereum communities sprouting in Latin America](https://twitter.com/EFDevcon/status/1527683213216325635?s=20&t=AT-Uo8eNqgdbnLV3f-pzmg), and the potential growth is tremendous. This is why we are excited to bring Devcon to Colombia this year.
