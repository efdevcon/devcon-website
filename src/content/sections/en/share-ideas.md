We are always striving to improve Devcon for everyone. However, we are aware that our perspective is limited. **This is why we introduced DIPs: Devcon Improvement Proposals.**
DIPs are a way for everyone to bring in ideas and experiences. If there’s something you really didn’t like at previous Devcons, **[head over to the forum](https://forum.devcon.org)** to discuss your ideas to make things better than ever.
