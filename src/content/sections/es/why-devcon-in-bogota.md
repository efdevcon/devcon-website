title: '¿Por qué Devcon en Bogota?'

  In Bogotá we found the seeds for an ambitious community that our ecosystem
  could help grow. From builders, to educational entities, local business and
  industry leaders and more, we’re excited to meet and to work with those making
  real-world use of Ethereum’s technology locally, and to further those efforts

  In addition to the potential to grow a community, the venue is located just
  minutes from hotels, and from both Bogota’s El Dorado International Airport,
  and the historic Santa Fe and Candelaria neighborhoods. The fully modern
  conference center is built to handle everything the Devcon requires, from
  catering, to wifi, meeting-space and more.


  Our search for fitting Devcon 6 began prior to Devcon 5. After exploring venues in over ten cities across the world, and meticulously evaluating each against an extensive set of criteria, the clear winner was Bogota, Colombia.


  This process has been long and somewhat delicate given the complicated year that we’ve all had, but we are excited and confident for Devcon 6 in Bogota.
