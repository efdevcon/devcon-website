  The capital of Colombia is located in one of the six regions of the country,
  the Andean Region, which is located throughout the center of the Colombian
  territory. In the Cundiboyacense plateau and on the savanna that bears its
  name at an altitude or elevation of 2,600 meters above the sea level.


  The city is also very green thanks to its parks and the hills that extend along its eastern boundary, dwarfed by their two highest points,  **Monserrate** and **Guadalupe**. The landscape that the people of Bogotá enjoy daily—the sea of green that makes up the Andes mountain range, rising up in the east—would be nearly impossible to find in any other large city.
