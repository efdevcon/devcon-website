**Devcon Improvement Proposals (DIPs)** provide a mechanism for collecting collaborative community input on what should be included at the upcoming Devcon. While we are excited to have a more formal process to hear ideas from the community (roughly inspired by the more decentralized PEP, BIP and EIP processes), this is an experiment, and it should be understood that approval of proposals ultimately lies solely with the Devcon team. DIPs focus on collaboration in the ecosystem between different projects.

The Devcon team also publishes **Requests For Proposals (RFPs)**, which are specific ideas we'd love to see take place for the next Devcon edition. They are available on our forum.
