title: What is a DIP

DIP stands for Devcon Improvement Proposal. A DIP is a proposal put forth by members of the community describing a desired new feature or process to improve Devcon. A DIP should be concise and provide as much information as possible as well as a rationale for the proposal.

The DIP author is responsible for making the case for a proposed DIP, and community members will be able to comment on it. It is up to the Devcon Team to choose which proposals are considered, reviewed, and accepted.

The Devcon Team intends DIPs to provide a mechanism for collecting collaborative community input on what should be included at the upcoming Devcon. While we are excited to have a more formal process to hear ideas from the community (roughly inspired by the more decentralized PEP, BIP and EIP processes), this is an experiment, and it should be understood that approval of proposals ultimately lies solely with the Devcon team. DIPs focus on collaboration in the ecosystem, so please review and collaborate on other proposals rather than submitting possible duplicates.
