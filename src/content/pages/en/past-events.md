Everything began in Berlin Kreuzberg in 2014 when the co-founders and earliest builders of Ethereum came together for a meet-up they named Devcon 0. Since then, Devcon has rotated the world. The journey went from Berlin to London, Shanghai, Cancún, Prague, Osaka and Bogotá. Each location brings something unique to the developer conference.
