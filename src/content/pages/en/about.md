title: About Devcon
---

Devcon is an annual gathering held by the Ethereum Foundation. It is an intensive introduction for new Ethereum explorers, a global family reunion for those already embedded within our ecosystem, and a source of energy and creativity for all.

Programming covers content ranging from the deeply technical to the profoundly human. This is a conference for builders of all kinds: developers, designers, researchers, client implementers, test engineers, infrastructure operators, community organizers, social economists, artists, and more.

We host Devcon to educate and empower the community to build and use decentralized systems. Our goal is to push the boundaries of possibility in our mission to bring decentralized protocols, tools, and culture to the world
