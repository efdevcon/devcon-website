Devcon VI in Bogotá featured a Public Goods Supporters Program that replaced a traditional sponsorship effort.

Our team owes a big thank you to those teams and DAOs that joined our first-ever Supporter Program without most benefits expected by sponsors.

The participating teams deserve special thanks for their contributions to Ethereum-related public goods funding, including the [ETHColombia Quadratic Funding Round @ Devcon](https://ethcolombia.clr.fund/), [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/), [CLR.Fund’s open grants](https://clr.fund/), and the [Protocol Guild](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (which supports core Ethereum research and development).
