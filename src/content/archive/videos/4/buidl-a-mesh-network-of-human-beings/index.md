title: "BUIDL a Mesh Network of Human Beings"
description: "As the Ethereum community doubles down their focus on creating usable dApps, its important to remember that we're designing for 3 dimensional humans.  How do these humans organize, and how will their organizations be different from the hierarchical organizations of yesteryear?  What are best practices for organizing groups of humans in a peer to peer way.In this devcon4 lightning talk, Gitcoin Founder Kevin Owocki will talk about best practices for creating intrinsic motivation that creates collective action in p2p networks of human beings"
