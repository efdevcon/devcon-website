title: "Nethermind - .NET Core Ethereum Client"
description: "If you are familiar with .NET and new to Ethereum programming, this workshop will teach you how to integrate .net applications or new dapps with Ethereum smart contracts using Nethereum. This programming session will guide through the creation of a standard token (ERC20 smartcontract) as well as through the creation of a .Net api definition and interaction with a smart contract (deployment, transactions, calls and events). Members of the Nethereum team will of course be there to answer any questions you may have regarding Ethereum programming and its cumulated benefits when used in the .NET context."
