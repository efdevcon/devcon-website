title: "Web3 Design Systems - components and design standards for better dApp UX"
description: "As a continuation of the Web3 Design Principles, our group has launched a community wide research for the most common UX problems in the ecosystem, with the objective of creating a Web3 Design System that includes: -The Web3 Design Language: that will research and consolidate a series of guidelines and Design Principles, (similar to Google's Material Design minus the styling suggestions), focused around the specific UX needs of distributed applications, as well as producing a series of proposals to map and solve some of the open-ended design challenges of this space (ie. key management, \"login\" patterns, asynchronicity etc). -a Web3 Design Library of components, a bootstrap like library for quickly developing dapp front-ends that implement the principles of the guidelines and give consistent UX across dapps. Although at Devcon the interviews will still be happening, we would like to share some initial insights that will emerge from the interviews. The objective is to share with the largest possible audience some of the most common and urgent UX problems and some ideas about how to solve them."
