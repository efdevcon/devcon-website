title: "Plasma Cash: Towards improved Plasma constructions"
description: "Plasma is a technique which is used to increase Ethereum transaction throughput, while maintaining network decentralization and security. We focus on the variant of Plasma called Plasma Cash, which allows for highly performant sidechains in production, today. We discuss Plasma Exits and Challenges as well as explore the User Interface choices for Plasma Apps. We go over the challenges encountered during the development and final implementation of a Plasma chain and contract. The presentation will highlight the advantages and disadvantages of using Plasma Cash, as well as practical examples of Plasma for Non Fungible Tokens and gaming. Finally, we'll talk about edge-cases such as griefing attacks, and future work towards making Plasma implementations more efficient, such as fast exits through liquidity providers, coin checkpointing through Plasma XT and arbitrary coin denominations through Plasma Debit. The audience is expected to walk away with a detailed understanding of how Plasma Chains should be built as well as the inner workings of the Plasma Cash technique. More experienced individuals who understand but are not following Plasma actively are expected to walk away with an overview of the current status of Plasma research and development, and motivated to tackle the existing open research problems."
