title: "Turbo-Geth: optimising Ethereum clients"
description: "As Ethereum network becomes gets more and more use, the load on the system grows, and the scalability becomes the primary concern. While concepts like Plasma, State Channels, and Sharding offer medium to long term solutions, client software optimisation have a potential to create enough runway in the short term. Turbo-Geth is an experiment to challenge various design choices made in major Ethereum clients and see the outcome. It is currently a fork of go-ethereum, but hopefully the insights are applicable to other client implementations too. This presentation will report on main experiments, findings, benchmarks, and the current state of Turbo-Geth project."
