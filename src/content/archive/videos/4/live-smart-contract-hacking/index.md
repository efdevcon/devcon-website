title: "Live Smart Contract Hacking"
description: "In this break-out session, a panel of well-renowned hackers and builders will perform security assessments of contracts that the audience submits - and anyone in the room is highly encouraged to help out and take part in the audit. There will not be time to perform full-scale reviews, but the panel will discuss the contracts both from a high-level perspective and also dive into the nitty gritty details, to see if we can find faults in the implementation. This is a panel session, where we want to interact with the community and bash as many bugs as possible, and hopefully demonstrate how tricky it can be to program for the EVM. Mistakes are what makes us learn: There shall be no shaming of anyone who submits a contract for review."
