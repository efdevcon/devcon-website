title: "Universal Ethereum Logins"
description: "A modest proposal to improve usability in Ethereum apps by removing a lot of the friction created by the usual login system: Your users can use your app without needing to install anything, buy ether or even type a password -Users are identified by a ENS username, and not a hex address -Users can use tokens to interact with your app, and you can even give out some of them free to encourage usage -Users are in control of their identity and any assets that are tied to them, and can take them to other apps -When users log into their identity with other apps, these act as second or third factors authenticators. While the app relies on a server, the server’s only job is to relay messages to the chain and pay ether, and the user can use any server they want. This is all achieved by using client side signed messages and multiple standards. Live code will be presented."
