title: "Gnosis Safe - Make dealing with crypto a less scary thing"
description: "The Safe is the first smart contract based multi-signature wallet targeting mobile users. Using smart contracts as proxies between users and dApps opens the door for many usability and security improvements. New access control schemes can be implemented to allow for 2FA and recovery mechanisms making private key management redundant. Transactions can be sent via relay services, which can be paid in any kind of token. Users won't need Ether anymore to interact with the Ethereum network. Usability and costs for dApps can be improved by batching transactions together making user flows simpler and more intuitive.
The presentation will give a detailed overview about the Safe implementation of the different features and how they can be used for future dApp development.More information and a download to the testnet beta can be found here:
