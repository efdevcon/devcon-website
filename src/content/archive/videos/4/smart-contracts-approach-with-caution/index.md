title: "Smart contracts: Approach with caution"
description: "Some of Ethereum’s most critical use cases come from it’s ability to create smart contracts, but this feature has a downside. Transactions no longer either succeed or fail, there are partial failure states that affect what occurred and all variations need to be accounted for when people get paid from it. Jake will discuss how Coinbase mitigates these risks and ensures smart contract transactions are handled safely."
