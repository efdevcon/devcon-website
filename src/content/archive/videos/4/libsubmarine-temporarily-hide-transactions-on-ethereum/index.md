title: "LibSubmarine - Temporarily hide transactions on Ethereum"
description: "LibSubmarine is a modular implementation of the Submarine Sends framework proposed by the team at IC3. While a standard commit-reveal scheme allows users to temporarily obfuscate data included in their transaction, Submarine Sends allow users to completely hide their transaction until revealed in a later block. Notable use cases include preventing frontrunning on DEXs, working sealed-bid auctions, and private voting with public tally. This is an open source and gas efficient implementation which anyone can add to their project. Built by the community, for the community. Slides: https://goo.gl/ncn3xG"
