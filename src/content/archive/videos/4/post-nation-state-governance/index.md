title: "Post Nation-State Governance"
description: "The contemporaneous world order we have today emerged during the Westphalia Treaties of the 17th century after 30 years of war in Europe following a clear set of principles: frontiers, non-domestic intervention and power alliances that keep the peace through a Nash equilibrium. As the internet and blockchains become a dominant economic force able to break the limits imposed by Nation-States (ie: \"Facebook and the Russians\"), the quest to seek a new equilibrium of power has begun. Democracy Earth researches smart contracts able to deliver an alternative to traditional democracy using the Ethereum network addressing key issues of voting systems including coercion and bribe resistance."
