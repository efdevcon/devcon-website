title: "Snarks for mixing, signaling and scaling"
description: "There is general interest in the ethereum community to scale ethereum by moving dapps inside snarks. The key to do this is to make an efficient signature function available inside a snark. We present this signature function https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/baby_jubjub_ecc designed to work efficiently inside a snark. Furthermore we describe an architecture to scale ethereum using snarks. We discuss the trade offs required and compare them to building a dapp inside the evm."
