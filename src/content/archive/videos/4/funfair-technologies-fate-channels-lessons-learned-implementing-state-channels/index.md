title: "FunFair Technologies' Fate Channels: Lessons learned Implementing State Channels"
description: "Jeremy Longley, CTO of FunFair Technologies, will offer a post-mortem on the delivery of their own version of state channels, Fate Channels, to Mainnet. There have been significant challenges along the way, and there's likely to be many more to come as their use scales up. Having deployed a flexible and creative approach, Jeremy will outline how others can bypass these challenges and embrace state channels as best they can."
