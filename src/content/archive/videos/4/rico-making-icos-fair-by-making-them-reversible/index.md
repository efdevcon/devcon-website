title: "RICO - Making ICOs Fair, By Making Them Reversible"
description: "The ERC 20 had far more impact than I expected when I proposed the draft in November 2015. The massive amounts of ICOs following the adoption of this standard led to money collection becoming a breeze. As much as this democratised the space, it also led to massive amounts of money being collected, where not all projects lived up to the expectation they created, while opening the door to not ICO-able projects, as well as outright scams. It's time to bring back balance, by letting participants decide if they deem a project worthy their funding - over time. The RICO, or Reversible ICO is a proposal I introduced a few months back that has the potential to make ICOs more fair. This happens by releasing the funds over time and giving each participant the power to cut his funding to the project at any time."
