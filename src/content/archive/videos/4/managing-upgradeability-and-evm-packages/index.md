title: "Managing upgradeability and EVM packages"
description: "At Zeppelin, we have been working on a toolset for deploying and managing upgradeable smart contracts and on-chain libraries, we have had the opportunity to collaborate with other teams to gather better understanding on their needs. We have also onboarded several projects to share their code on-chain via a common package registry. We are building an open source tool that offers the best possible developer experience for securely managing smart contract applications. In this talk we will revisit the importance of upgradeability in smart contracts security, present the lessons learned from this semester of usage, and share the work we have been doing as a result."
