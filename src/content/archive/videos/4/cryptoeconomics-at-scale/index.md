title: "Cryptoeconomics at Scale"
description: "The next wave of internet applications will not only compete on functionality, but also incentives. With cryptoeconomic research we are witnessing the beginnings of incentive analysis being applied to the architecture of internet protocols. As this body of research grows, common methodologies are beginning to emerge. These methodologies are also beginning to be composed to produce even more sophisticated and scalable protocols. This talk provides an overview of these cryptoeconomic methodologies and calls for help in the quest to build a fairer web."
