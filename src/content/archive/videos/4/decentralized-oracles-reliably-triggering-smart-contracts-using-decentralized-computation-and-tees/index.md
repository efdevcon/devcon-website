title: "Decentralized Oracles: Reliably Triggering Smart Contracts using Decentralized Computation and TEEs"
description: "We’ll define and examine what makes a secure oracle mechanism reliable enough to be used by smart contracts for external data delivery, off-chain payment execution, and provable off-chain computation. We’ll go over the security risks and failure scenarios to be avoided based on various smart contract’s reliance on an oracle mechanism as their trigger and/or payment mechanism; closely examining the methods that developers should keep in mind for minimizing the most common failure scenarios. We’ll look in depth at how decentralization can help make oracle mechanisms more secure through the use of a decentralized oracle network, while also presenting a defense in-depth approach that applies additional layers of security through the use of Trusted Execution Environments, and cutting edge approaches like TownCrier."
