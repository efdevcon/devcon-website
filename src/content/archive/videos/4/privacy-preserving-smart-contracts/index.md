title: "Privacy Preserving Smart Contracts"
description: "An overview of the privacy-preserving smart contract landscape. Examines the 3 main approaches: trusted execution environments (TEE), secure multi-party computation (sMPC), and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), and their respective tradeoffs to achieving computation over private data. I talk about the different companies doing each approach and I propose a way to synthesize all 3 approaches coherently.  There is a full blog post about the topic here: http://juliankohtx.com/privacy-preserving-smart-contracts/"
