title: "Ewasm: Ethereum-flavored WebAssembly and Ethereum 2.0 - Part 2"
description: "Ewasm is a candidate for the future Ethereum engine to replace EVM with the rollout of Shasper. Ewasm stands for Ethereum-flavored WebAssembly and it encompasses a broad range of initiatives being led by the Foundation Ewasm team including building an execution engine for Ethereum 2.0, adding support for a host of languages including C++, Rust, and AssemblyScript, and lots of related research and tooling to make Ethereum development easier and more powerful than ever. The team is in the process of launching a public testnet and releasing tooling which will be officially announced in this breakout session. In addition, members of the Ewasm team will introduce the technology, walk through the new stack, and give demos of the bleeding edge development tooling we've built around Rust, AssemblyScript, and other frameworks. We'll have an hour-long workshop where developers can download the new tools and get their hands dirty, building and deploying their first Ewasm-compatible smart contracts, with the team serving as mentors."
