title: "How do we control the material world with smart contracts?"
description: "The long term vision for the Ethereum community has always been that car rentals, high finance and Cryptokitties would all co-exist on the same blockchain. However, some assets (like Cryptokitties) are purely digital whereas others are purely material (your house) and automatically subject to fiat regulation.Â How are we to manage fiat property using crypto tools? Vinay will present the results of several years of research in the practical legal technicalities of controlling fiat property from Ethereum smart contracts, with examples from a variety of real world use cases."
