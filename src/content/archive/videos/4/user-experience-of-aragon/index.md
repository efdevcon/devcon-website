title: "User Experience of Aragon"
description: "Problematic user experience of decentralised applications has been a major factor in slow adoption of them. We think this is attributable partially due to incomplete technology, but also to lack of established design patterns and design systems in the space. Through the work we have done with Aragon, and other open source projects like Ubuntu and Matrix/Riot redesign we think increased attention to design can really help push these important technologies to wider audiences. We would like to share learnings from these projects. Additionally, we are announcing a new open source design system and UI component library - Lorakeet -  for decentralised applications, using React and Styled Components for theming. We hope it will help developers and designers build dapps with a good level of baseline design choices and code quality, and that the community will adopt and contribute to it."
