title: "Building self-sustaining ecosystems through governance"
description: "At 0x, we would like to move towards progressive decentralization of network ownership and control. As a first step, we will launch a community-managed developer grant program that is intended to provide funding for public interest projects that advance the community’s collective interest and that drive platform growth. To take this one step further, we are developing a roadmap for transferring control of grant distribution and custody of grant funds to an on-chain decentralized governance system administered by the ZRX token holders themselves. The grant program will provide us with a unique opportunity to observe on-chain governance and community social dynamics when the financial stakes are real and no centralized authorities can interfere with the community's decisions."
