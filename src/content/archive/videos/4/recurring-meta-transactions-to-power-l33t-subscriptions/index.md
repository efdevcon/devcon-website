title: "Recurring meta transactions to power l33t subscriptions!"
description: "Dapps require way too much on-boarding. The Ethereum ecosystem needs to push toward mass adoption by allowing new users immediate access to functionality and interactivity without all the hoops to jump through.
This means paying the gas for first time users' transactions. 
Thanks to public/private key pairs, users can sign meta transactions and incentivize desktop miners to pay the gas for them.
I will demonstrate how etherless accounts can craft and sign transaction off-chain and send them to a relayer. The relayer, incentivized by the a reward in the transaction, submit the the meta transaction to a bouncer proxy and pay the gas. 
This also works great for Universal Logins where you have an identity proxy that your etherless devices can transact through."
