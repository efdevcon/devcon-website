title: "Building Cross Ecosystem Communities: A Playbook"
description: "Describing the playbook used to identify and then encourage cross project collaboration to solve problems affecting all projects in the ETH ecosystem.  Drawing on lessons learned from ETHPrize, ETHSecurity, Web 3.0 Design, the Open Source Block Explorer Group and the Community of Communities (learning resource for Community Managers) --- a brief history around how these groups were built (each has become a cornerstone in the community for it's topic), the tactics and tools used to manage them, and how to set goals and get results.  The format would be a talk around what these communities are reviewing the above and then an open workshop to come up with creative ideas for future useful communities and how to build them.  The goal is to facilitate new community ideas where grouping stakeholders could be super valuable and come up with creative ways to either grow the existing community base or start new ones.  I would like to split into small groups where people could come up with Community Ideas and then present them live to the group with feedback from a panel of community experts.  There aren't many resources for building communities and even fewer talks and workshops on this topic."
