title: "Ethereum on Android - Chances and Challenges"
description: "In this presentation I want to talk about challenges and chances for Ethereum on the Android platform. This platform can enable access to a huge amount of users and open up a lot of use-cases. It can also help us improve security - e.g. by using old phones as offline signing devices, leveraging the app-sandboxing or really split application from wallet with UX patterns users are familiar with from online banking. But all these chances come with challenges. Light clients and their incentivisation layer here I will be a big topic here. I will try to address the challenges and point out possible solutions. This talk will also contain a small assessment of the current state of the art. Comparing several solutions and approaches. Not only of existing applications - but also standards in this area."
