title: "Building a state channel application"
description: "State channels are a great tool for building high-performance, low-cost dapps today. By moving some of your dapp behaviour off-chain you can save transaction fees and confirmation times, while continuing to bootstrap security and trustlessness from the underlying blockchain. In order to understand how an application can benefit from state channels, it’s important to understand the mechanics behind them. The good news is that once you’ve managed to model part of your application as a state channel interaction, there are already tools available to help make the switch.In this interactive workshop, we will dig into an existing state channel application. We’ll cover the fundamentals of state channels, as well as the main design decisions behind modeling the interactions and architecting the application. You’ll test your understanding by completing key sections of the code, leaving the session with a functioning state channel application, built with react on top of the force-move games framework!"
