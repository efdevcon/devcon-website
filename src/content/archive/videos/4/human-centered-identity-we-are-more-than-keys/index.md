title: "Human Centered Identity: We are more than keys"
description: "Much of the discussion around identity in our industry is centered on specific identifiers, authentication standards, open protocols, etc. However, I think we need to consider identity from the human outward. What do we care about when we talk about identity? How does identity relate to reputation? What does self-sovereignty actually mean? And of course, what do we need to consider when designing experiences to support the most fundamental aspects of ourselves. Privacy, security, accessibility and flexibility become increasingly critical in this context. The goal of this presentation is to first establish a shared understanding of the fundamental concepts and behaviors we are trying to translate online. To do this, I draw on philosophy, psychology and sociology. Then, an examination of the current state of digital identity and it's many design flaws. And finally, a road towards a solution. Where are we so far? What have we learned about addressing the privacy and security concerns of people through design? What are the current best practices and thinking around designing experiences for interacting and managing your identity. It's been said that money is the killer app of crypto, but what is worth more: you money or your identity?"
