title: "ENS Ethereum Name Service On-boarding Booth"
description: "The Ethereum Name Service is one of the key projects that aim at simplifying the use of Ethereum by converting long and complicated hashes (user addresses, contract address, IPFS url etc) into simple memorable short names. Instead of writing 0x123...ABC the users can simply write “me.somedomain.eth”. Although the result is simple, it requires some complicated interactions to register a domain and assign it to the user’s desired address. The aim of the on-boarding booth is to help as many people as possible to start using these names right away guiding them through the process of: - Registering a subdomain (free or paying) which is an instant process - Pointing it to their address - Set the reverse address so that Dapps can show their name instead of the address - Eventually explain and guide them through the initial phases of registering a full .eth domain that requires to go through the 5 day Vickrey auction process that is the most confusing step for every user"
