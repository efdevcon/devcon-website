title: "Reversing Ethereum Smart Contracts to find out what's behind EVM bytecode"
description: "Reverse engineering is a common technique used by security researcher to understand and analyze the behavior of closed-source binaries. If you apply this to Ethereum smart contract (and more specifically on the EVM bytecode), thats allow you to analyze and verify the result of your Solidity source code compilation. From a developer point of view, it can save you a lot of time and money if you succeed to detect flaws and missing bytecode optimization. Also, providing the Solidity source code it's not mandatory during the smart contract creation, that’s why being able to directly reverse the EVM bytecode make even more sense if you want to understand the behavior of external smart contracts."
