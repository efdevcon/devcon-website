title: "Decentralized Identity & Reputation"
description: "Since leaving Truebit, I have been focused on the problem of decentralized identity and reputation. This is an important missing primitive that enables some of the most exciting blockchain use-cases: governance (e.g. quadratic voting), airdrops, unsecured unchain lending, and security tokens. Reputation enables protocols to utilize iterated games instead of one-off games; and identity enables much better UX for usage of dapps.
I would like to give a 20 minute presentation on our research into identity and reputation. I will begin by demonstrating the importance of reputation in the pseudonymous decentralized context, present the possible architectures under consideration (1) based on trust graphs and PageRank, 2) based on social collateral, and 3) based on attestations made by anchors, and finally discuss open problems in order to engage the attendees on this topic going forward.
Our recent breakout session in San Francisco (with engineers from Metamask, Dharma, Protocol Labs, and Google Brain) demonstrates some of our latest thinking on this topic! – https://twitter.com/sinahab/status/1027639769910525952"
