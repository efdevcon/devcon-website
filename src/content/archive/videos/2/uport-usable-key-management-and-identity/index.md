title: "uPort â€“ Usable key management & identity"
description: "uPort is an Ethereum-based identity system that aims among other things to provide a smooth end-user experience for interacting with Ethereum dapps. Part of the challenge when interacting with blockchain systems is that the end user is in charge of key management, which is a major hurdle for the unsophisticated user."
