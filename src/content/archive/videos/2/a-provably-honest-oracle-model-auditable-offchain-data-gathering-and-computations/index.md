title: "A Provably Honest Oracle Model: Auditable Offchain Data Gathering and Computations"
description: "Providing offchain data to Ethereum contracts is hard. The model we present enables an offchain party to act as a provably honest oracle which can give strong authenticity guarantees for both data and computations. This novel approach prevents it to tamper any data, while being able to deliver them to the blockchain. This is possible thanks to an extensive use of smart HW and SW techniques based on TLSNotary, Intel SGX and Qualcomm TrustZone among the others."
