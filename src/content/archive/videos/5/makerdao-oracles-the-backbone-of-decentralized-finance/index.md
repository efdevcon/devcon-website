title: "MakerDAO Oracles: The Backbone of Decentralized Finance"
description: "For the past two years, MakerDAO's Oracles have been running on Mainnet, powering not only the 500 million Dollar Dai Credit System, but most of the Decentralized Finance projects that run peripheral to it, like secondary lending platforms.In this presentation, you'll learn about the history of MakerDAO's Oracles, what worked, what didn't, and get a good look at the Version 2 Oracles that will power Multi-Collateral Dai and the rest of Decentralized Finance on Ethereum."
