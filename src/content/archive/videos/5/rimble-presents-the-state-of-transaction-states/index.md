title: "Rimble presents: the state of transaction states"
description: "Whenever we speak to builders they say \"the most pain-in-the-ass part of making dApps is those pesky transaction states\" (paraphrased). So we decided to do some of the work for you and now we want to share it.
Over the last few months we've been turning transaction states inside-out to grasp the do's and don'ts of keeping users in the loop about their on-chain activities. And what this means for how you should build them.
We asked ourselves:
What do users want to know? What are they thinking after 2 minutes and it looks like nothing's happened? Should we use blockchain lingo? Do users actually trust dApp transaction messages? And what happens if you run out of gas? Plus, plenty more.
Then we interviewed, designed, tested, demoed, iterated and repeated in order to get the answers you and every dApp developer needs. At this talk, we'll share everything we've learned and show you how you can turn these user insights into great user experiences for your own projects."
