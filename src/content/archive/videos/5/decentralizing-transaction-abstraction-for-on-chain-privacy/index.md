title: "Decentralizing Transaction Abstraction for On Chain Privacy"
description: "Transaction abstraction (or meta transactions, if you prefer) isn't a new idea in Ethereum. The idea, roughly, is that users sometimes want a 3rd party, called relayers, to pay gas for their transactions for them.
To support on-chain privacy apps like the MicroMix mixer, we've designed a decentralized transaction abstraction system with 2 particularly novel ideas:a transaction simulation engine that allows anyone to run a relayer with minimal configurationa trustless reputation/spam-prevention system for relayers, that we call the 'burn registry'
In this talk, I'll:present the design space of transaction abstraction and some of the crypto-economic challenges in building such a systempresent the solution we've built for MicroMix
and finally, share software that you can run today to be a relayer on our network."
