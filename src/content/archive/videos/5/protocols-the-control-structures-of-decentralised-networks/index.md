title: "Protocols: the control structures of decentralised networks"
description: "Protocols are essential for the formation of (decentralised) networks, both for humans and machines. Protocol designs directly influence the interaction between agents and also the kinds of networks that are able to form. This is especially important when trying to build inclusive and open networks.
This talk will give the audience a glimpse into the protocol design world and should serve as an entry point for people to get interested in the topic.
I will cover some philosophical angles, what it actually means to design protocols; provide motivation as to why making a conscious effort to design protocols is necessary—also motivated by the growing popularity of DeFi applications and their influence on all levels of the blockchain stack—and give pointers for things to watch out for when it comes to writing specifications."
