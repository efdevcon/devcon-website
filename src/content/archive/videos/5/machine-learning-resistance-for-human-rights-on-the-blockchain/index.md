title: "Machine Learning Resistance for Human Rights on the Blockchain."
description: "Bitcoin’s original white paper description of “one
CPU one vote” (Nakamoto, 2008) shaped the software industry to think governance
centered around machines, instead of humans. Although a fundamental right to privacy
bent early blockchain design toward anonymity, this property facilitates the malicious use
of Sybil Attacks (Douceur, 2002) significantly undermining the governance capacity of
protocols.

The importance of formalizing human identities can be inferred from centralized networks:
major social media platforms were established when they achieved a sufficient level of
consensus over their identity protocols, thus creating a trust layer on top of which a myriad
of social applications could be built. This networked social infrastructure has in turn
facilitated the emergence and spread of multiple borderless political movements.
However, being highly vulnerable to several artificial intelligence exploits such as addictive
algorithms, bots and deep fake technology, the underlying architecture of current protocols
exposes society to political manipulation as well as data theft.

On this talk we'll explore the different approaches to reach a “one human one node” graph,
providing protocol specifications able to serve as a source of legitimacy in the governance
of digital networks and strategies that can keep these protocols free from AI."
