title: "Overcoming the smart contract size limit"
description: "EIP 170 introduced a limit of 24KB on bytecode size of smart contracts in Ethereum. This talk will explain the rationale behind the decision and then talk about overcoming or playing around the limit. The talk will cover ways like proxy patterns and libraries for working around the limit. Tips on optimizing code for reducing bytecode size will also be shared. The talk will then explain new proposals for removing the contract size limit while still fixing the original problem."
