title: "Smart contract interaction out of the coldest of storage"
description: "At Coinbase Custody, we provide top of the line security for our client's assets. This security comes at a cost though. Through its very nature, our cold storage process creates friction when broadcasting transactions to the network. For HODLers, this friction is a welcome and blessed thing, as it keeps their funds safe. When our clients want to use their funds to participate in decentralized applications however, we have had to get creative. This talk will focus on the patterns we have developed to facilitate rich and convenient network participation between our clients and the decentralized networks they patronize."
