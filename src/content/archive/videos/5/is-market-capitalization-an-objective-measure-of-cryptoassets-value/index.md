title: "Is Market Capitalization an Objective Measure of Cryptoassetsâ€™ Value?"
description: "The cryptoasset industry is fixated on market capitalization as a metric in determining the success of any particular project. In this talk, we will shed some light on how market capitalization can be easily manipulated and is not entirely the best metric to value cryptoassets. More due diligence should be applied before trusting any market capitalization number published anywhere."
