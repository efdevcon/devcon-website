title: "Data privacy and provenance with OpenAttestation"
description: "OpenAttestation is the framework powering the nation-wide blockchain based digital education credentials solution, OpenCerts, in Singapore. OpenAttestation turns documents into structured verifiable claims and allow the provenance of the documents to be verified on the Ethereum blockchain. These documents put users in control of their own data by allowing them to selectively obfuscate parts of the data in the document without compromising on the integrity of the document. 
This presentation will focus on key learning point from deploying such solution at a nation scale:
Batch issuing large number of documents
Selective disclosure of data
Decentralized document templating and rendering
