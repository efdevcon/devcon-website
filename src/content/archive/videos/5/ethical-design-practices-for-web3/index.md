title: "Ethical design practices for web3"
description: "In this talk, we'll share the MetaMask Permission System, a set of agreements between web applications and users that could help make new/emerging web user experiences more trustworthy. 
We now have enough evidence that illustrates how users’ trust is being broken by today’s web, and how user experience is fundamentally broken due to lack of user control, lack of choice, unethical data sharing practices, and use of dark patterns by websites.
Web3 has attempted to address some of these issues, but so far our user research points to a lack of maturity in creating useful & engaging experiences.
We'll share applied design practices that help keep users in-charge (e.g., design suggestions for informed consent, aid decision making, privacy & security by default, etc.), without interfering in enjoyable browsing experiences."
