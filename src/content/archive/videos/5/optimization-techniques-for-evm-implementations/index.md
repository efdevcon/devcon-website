title: "Optimization techniques for EVM implementations"
description: "A number of optimization techniques for Ethereum Virtual Machine implementations are going to be presented along with examples and benchmarks based on evmone and EVMJIT projects.
Based on performed benchmarks, the presentation will show ~10x speed improvements in evmone comparing to other EVM implementations.
 While evmone is build in C++, the optimizations are not limited to C++. All of the optimizations are applicable to any compiled language, some of them even to interpreted languages."
