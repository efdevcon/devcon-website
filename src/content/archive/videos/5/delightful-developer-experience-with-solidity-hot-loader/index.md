title: "Delightful Developer Experience with Solidity Hot Loader"
description: "Mass adoption of Ethereum requires attracting both users and developers. Developers trying to enter Ethereum are often pushed away by unstable libraries, lack of documentation and poor developer tools. The typical Solidity development cycle is: change a Solidity code, compile the code, restart a local node, apply an initial state, and restart a frontend app. It can be reduced to just saving Solidity source code and all the changes will propagate automatically. We present a practical implementation of Solidity Hot Loader as well as a generic approach to enable it across the entire Ethereum developer space."
