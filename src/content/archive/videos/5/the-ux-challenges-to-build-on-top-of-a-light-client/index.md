title: "The UX challenges to build on top of a light client"
description: "In the past year, we have been building Fether, a wallet based on a 
light client. Although the connection to a node is a fundamental part of
 building a DApp, it is often considered secondary as connection can be 
achieved for free using a 3rd party node. We will present the UX 
patterns that we have developed in Fether to allow for a great UX, 
without necessarily have access to a full node."
