description: "From launching CryptoKitties at the ETHWaterloo hackathon to the rise of KittyVerse experiences and designing Cheeze Wizards to be more extensible, our successes and failures have advised us each step of the way. Join this talk where we will share more about what we learned (sometimes the hard way) in designing for open ecosystems and how iterative improvement on smart contracts has the power to result in stronger development communities."
