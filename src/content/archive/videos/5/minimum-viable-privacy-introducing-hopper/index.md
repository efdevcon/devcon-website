title: "Minimum Viable Privacy: Introducing Hopper"
description: "Hopper is an Open-Source Mixer for Mobile-friendly private transfers on Ethereum. It allows the private transfer of value from one Ethereum account to another, via an iOS client.
Users can deposit notes of 1 ETH into a mixer smart contract and withdraw them later to a different account by only providing a Zero-Knowledge proof (zkSNARK) that they previously deposited a note into the mixer, without revealing from which account that note was sent.
Relayers are used to post transactions to the blockchain so that the recipient of a private transfer can withdraw a private note from the mixer without needing any prior ether.
This project is based on previous work on trustless Ethereum mixers by @barryWhiteHat and @HarryR.
This talk will discuss the development of Hopper, how others can contribute, and the next steps to make it a true utility for the community."
