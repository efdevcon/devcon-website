title: "ERC725 - The future of on chain interaction"
description: "One of the biggest problems for blockchain its is difficulty to store and secure assets and manage interacting with a blockchain. The main cause is the use of private keys for the source of interactions on-chain. ERC725 is a standard proposed to make abstract accounts from keys to a smart contract account. This not only makes security upgradable, but lets accounts become information holders. Fabian Vogelsteller the author of ERC20 and ERC725, the Mist browser and web3.js will talk about how on-chain interaction should look like."
