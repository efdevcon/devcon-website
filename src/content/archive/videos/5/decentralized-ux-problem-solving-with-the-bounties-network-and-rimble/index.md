title: "Decentralized UX Problem-Solving with The Bounties Network and Rimble"
description: "The Bounties Network and Rimble are kicking off an experiment in decentralized problem solving. The Rimble team continuously researches critical UX problems that are hindering dApp adoption and usability. Through this initiative, we are incentivizing the generation of creative and effective solutions to dApp UX challenges through the use of bounties. Rimble will validate and iterate on the best solutions, ultimately incorporating them into open-source resources that make it easier for developers to build dApps for broad usability.
This session is for developers (primarily front-end/React), designers, and anyone interested in contributing their ideas and concepts with the aim of advancing the dApp experience with accessibility in mind for new and current users of the decentralized web.
We will be offering bounties as an incentive for participation as well as for providing feedback about the session and and the resources/tools used throughout. We want to see designs, prototypes, and working demos addressing some of the most critical segments of the dApp experience:

On-boarding new usersSmart contract interactionTransaction statusAddress exploration
Important aspects we will be considering are accessibility, color contrast, and error handling. Specific criteria will be posted on each bounty for participants to fulfill. The challenge doesn't end during the workshop. The workshop bounties will be active for the duration of the conference, and possibly beyond. At the conclusion of each bounty deadline we will determine winners and/or submissions to award based on criteria that we define, and based on the quality of execution and content of each submission."
