description: "Over the past several months, Ethereum's leading state channels researchers and engineers have worked to unify their protocols and implementations. The result is a single state channels network, compatible with all major state channel implementations.Â Liam Horne and Tom Close will introduce the audience to their work, the State Channels Improvement Proposals (SCIP) process, explain how developers can get started building on it, and provide a live demo of the network in action."
