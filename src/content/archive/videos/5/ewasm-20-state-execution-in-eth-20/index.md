title: "Ewasm 2.0 - State Execution in Eth 2.0"
description: "This session aims to bring clarity to what execution on Eth 2.0 means.
It will be presented by multiple members of the Ewasm team, starting with a historical overview of how Eth 2.0 designs evolved around execution, followed by deeper technical topics.
We will cover:
- Scout (an Eth 2.0 execution engine)
- Different execution environments (such as the \"Eth1 shard\")
- In-depth presentation of different designs used in the Eth 2.0 stateless model
- An Eth 2.0 execution testnet
If you are interested in stateless contracts and Merkle proofs, this is the session to attend."
