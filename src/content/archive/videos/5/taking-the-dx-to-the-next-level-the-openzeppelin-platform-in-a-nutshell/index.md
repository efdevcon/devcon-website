title: "Taking the DX to the next level: The OpenZeppelin Platform in a nutshell"
description: "The Ethereum developer ecosystem is in constant change. Undoubtedly, teams have started to leave the development of Smart Contracts in the background to focus on the development of decentralized applications and UX improvements on them. But developer experience is still important: We need the right tools to minimize the difficulty of working on Ethereum projects, while preserving high security standards. In this talk we will discuss how OpenZeppelin has been working on a frictionless tool for developing, deploying, upgrading and interacting with Smart Contracts and for creating DApps in an easy and secure way, introducing the latest version of the OpenZeppelin Platform."
