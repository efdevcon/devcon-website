title: "ZoKrates - Privacy for dApps"
description: "In this talk, we provide an update on the state, future, and vision of ZoKrates, the programming language and toolbox to bring zkSNARKs to Ethereum developers to enable privacy and scalability of their dApps.
We describe the evolution of the ZoKrates language, standard library, and tooling before outlining our view on ZoKrates’ role within the Ethereum ecosystem of the future.
To support this vision, we share insights gained from use case implementations where we enhanced the privacy of decentralized applications with ZoKrates."
