title: "(Defense Against) The Dark Arts - Contract Runtime Mutability"
description: "Smart contracts are no longer guaranteed to have immutable runtime code, and can be redeployed with new code using a variety of methods involving the CREATE2 and SELFDESTRUCT opcodes. In this presentation, we will investigate how this is done and how to protect against malicious mutable contracts. We will also explore ways these new techniques can be applied in order to enable new use-cases and to improve the user experience."
