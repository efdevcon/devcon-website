title: "The Use of Utility Token Staking Rewards"
description: "The utility token is based on the concept of user ownership. In principle, token-based voting can empower the users of a utility token project to oversee its long-term development. In practice, however, a very large proportion of circulating utility tokens are held by speculators, rather than actual users. The talk will discuss our efforts to improve the utility token model through the introduction of a staking process that incentivizes user ownership. We will explain the process we followed to map our governance
objectives into a specific staking mechanism. The talk will explain how this mechanism incentivizes ownership among a target user group, penalizes socially harmful behaviors, and collects and distributes fee revenue in a manner that satisfies basic fairness norms."
