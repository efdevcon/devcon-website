title: "Make the tests feel the user's pain - E2E testing for DApps"
description: "With the move from protocol development to more user-focused products, the decentralized applications are in a stage where frontend testing is not an easy task due to the lack of tools and experience in the field of Web3. Protocols have strong testing and auditing, but their user-facing apps lack a simple way to do so. In this workshop, we aim to explain how to start focusing on the user and ensure that they get what we expect even when the chain behaves unexpectedly.

The main things that we will touch in the workshop will be:
- Classic E2E tools (Puppeteer and Cypress)
- Why they don't work the same way in DApps
- How to use them with Web3 injectors like Metamask and connect to different testnets
- What are the key pieces to test

The workshop will start with a bit more of theory around testing and then we will move to a practical exercise where we will set up the architecture needed to properly test our decentralized app."
