title: "Trains, Planes and Network Upgrades: A Regular Release Cadence"
description: "How does an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) get deployed onto the Ethereum mainnet?  At times it feels like an â€˜80s buddy comedy, but as part of the Ethereum 1.x initiative, the process should become as predictable as a clock. In this talk, we will propose a regularly scheduled process modeled after Linux distributions and the Java platform that Ethereum could use for its future network upgrades. Frequent and regular network upgrades will remove the time pressure to submit and review EIPs, provide predictability to applications building on Ethereum and reduce the burden on core developers to begin implementing improvements that are not ready. Once a network upgrade leaves the station, another one will be coming right around the corner!"
