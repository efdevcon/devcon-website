title: "Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1&2 Developer Experience"
description: "In this breakout session, we would invite some prominent Dapp developers to discuss the developer experience with Ethereum 2.0 researchers and client implementers.
The goals of this session:
Phase 1 will enable some layer 2 scaling framework to be much more useful! What would the developers need to know? And what are the edge-cutting tools they can start to dig?Till today, the most promising Phase 2 proposal is the execution environment abstraction by Vitalik Buterin (https://notes.ethereum.org/s/Bkoaj4xpN). While this scheme would only add minor cost to migrate the existed Dapp, it would be great to understand the requirements from the perspective of developers.What's the user experience regarding cross-shard transactions?To get some more concrete ideas of the Eth2 tooling we will need."
