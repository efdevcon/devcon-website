title: "Complementing DApps with Trusted Computing: The Challenge of Designing Rock Solid Oracles"
description: "Decentralized Applications aim to change the way verticals across multiple industries work. An important element for this to happen is for smart contracts to access real-world data. Problem is, blockchain is a walled-garden and smart contracts cannot natively fetch data from the outside world. Blockchain oracles enable DApps to overcome this limitation. Designing such a tool is quite a challenge - elements such as security, decentralization and feasibility must be kept into consideration. Is blockchain a self-standing technology? Security-focused techniques such as Trusted Computing or ZKSnarks are being explored as a complementary technology enhancing the power of decentralized tools. How do those technologies complement each other? What’s the benefit for blockchain oracles to rely on both? And what’s the benefit for users?"
