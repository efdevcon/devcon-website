title: "Ethcon: build your local community's developer conference just like building an opensource together"
description: "Korean Ethereum community successfully hosted a local community-driven Ethereum developers' conference in May 27th-28th, 2019. 60 speakers, 500 participants, 16 donators, 16 sponsors, 11 media partners, and 20 volunteers made the conference together. Also, 'Ethcon Korea' could get grants from Ethereum Foundation for the effort to focus on the local voices and shed light on them. This speech tells about how we built that solely run by volunteering like building an open source together. To be more specific, we want to share our experience with other local communities and encourage them to make their own Ethcons through the following agendas:
Why we started the conference
How we prepared the conference in a decentralized manner
What happened so
How to make a community's own 'Ethcon'?"
