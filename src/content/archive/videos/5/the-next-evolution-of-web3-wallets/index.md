title: "The Next Evolution of Web3 Wallets"
description: "Metamask’s aim is to empower the web3 ecosystem to create useful and usable applications for users. We have led the way thus far by being a web3 connector and a wallet that serves different types of user groups, and hence juggle their different needs. We are at a critical turning point, where we believe a one-size-fits-all solution is not the answer. 
We are looking forward to make Metamask modular, more secure, and extensible that dapp builders can use for the specific needs of their end users. We’ll  do this with the help of new Metamask APIs, which will empower the developer community to build creative solutions that inherently integrate with Metamask. 
In this workshop, we will share developer beta version of Metamask APIs!
What you can expect from this workshop:
- You’ll learn about some new APIs the MetaMask team has been working on.
- You'll learn how to use these APIs to enhance your products’ functionality and UX.
- We'll bring a few working demos, and facilitate a brainstorm on how these features could help your users, and how we can improve them for you.
- Build a simple application that is made possible with these new APIs."
