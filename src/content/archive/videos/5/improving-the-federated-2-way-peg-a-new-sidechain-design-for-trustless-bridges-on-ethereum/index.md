title: "Improving the federated 2-way peg: A new sidechain design for trustless bridges on Ethereum"
description: "In this talk, we'll introduce a novel mechanism to maintain 2-way pegs, as well an initial implementation of a Bitcoin peg on Ethereum.
## Problem
Bitcoin's stable codebase is a strength. Developers are loathe to introduce significant changes, reasoning that a store of value should prioritize stable operation.
While this cemented Bitcoin's place in the market, we all know the costs- Bitcoin's ossification at the expense of public experimentation and diverse use cases.
In 2014, the answer to this problem was \"sidechains\". Trustless sidechains are the ultimate vaporware- and since 2014 the goalposts have moved.
## Approaches
Blockstream's Liquid touted itself as the \"first production sidechain\", built on a multi-sig federation. No hashpower validates the sidechain-- funds are fully trusted to 15 Bitcoin multi-sig participants.
BitGo's WBTC takes a similar tact-- but instead of building a new chain, custodians operate on Ethereum. Neat! Unfortunately, they require KYC :(
These centralized projects have a few custodians that can be convinced by governments-- or their own interests-- to censor or seize funds.
## Design
We propose a new approach-- the *bonded, multi-federated peg*. We believe this is the best candidate for a sufficiently trust-minimized alternative, unlocking Bitcoin for use in DeFi."
