title: "What is happening with Ethereum Classic?"
description: "2019 has been an exciting year for the Ethereum Classic community.Â Three years on from The DAO the focus is on developer experience, on coordinating hard forks to bring Byzantium, Constantinople and Istanbul changes to ETC, and looking forward to opportunities for collaboration with ETH 1.x. This presentation gives an overview of the ETC ecosystem, progress in the last year and some ideas on how ETH 1.x and ETC can work together for mutual benefit. Bob has worked at the Ethereum Foundation, ConsenSys, Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and now at the Ethereum Classic Cooperative."
