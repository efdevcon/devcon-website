title: "Practical design patterns for DApp developers"
description: "Used to building apps in Python or Ruby on Rails, but new to blockchain?
This talk is aimed at experienced developers who are new to Ethereum. My goal is to give developers practical frameworks for architecting their decentralized applications, that will minimize gas costs, reduce the attack surface and simplify upgrades. Decentralized applications require a new way of thinking. I want to share some templates for developers who are making the jump to decentralized applications and aren't familiar with the quirks and limitation of the Ethereum EVM. 
We will look at the following Solidity design patterns:

Approve and call
Factory contracts
Proxy contracts
Name registry
Upgradability
As well as ways to reduce gas costs without compromising on security, including:
Event sourcing
Using IPFS effectively

Building decentralized applications is hard. The stakes are high and there are a lot of ways to get things wrong. Mistakes can be expensive, either from security losses or high gas costs. I’m looking forward to sharing some of the lessons Origin’s engineering team has learned over the past two years building peer-to-peer marketplaces on top of Ethereum."
