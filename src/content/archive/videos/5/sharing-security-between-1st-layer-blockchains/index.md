title: "Sharing Security between 1st Layer Blockchains"
description: "Nowadays one of the evolving fields in the blockchain technology is a protocol which shares security between a main blockchain and a child blockchain. A protocol which shares it between main blockchains, however, is not developed yet. To do that, we would like to introduce a new Sybil control mechanism, Proof of Unit. In this protocol, a new concept, “unit” appears. The unit has three features. First, a unit is generated with any works such as mining, staking, computing prime numbers, and so on. Second, the amount of minted unit is in proportion to the consumed cost. Third, a unit is used as vote power in the consensus algorithm. Proof of Unit would make it possible for 1st layer blockchains to share their security."
