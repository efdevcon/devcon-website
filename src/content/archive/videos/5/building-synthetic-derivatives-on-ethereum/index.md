title: "Building Synthetic Derivatives on Ethereum"
description: "This workshop will teach participants how to build best-in-class financial contracts on Ethereum that can support a wide array of DeFi use cases. Using concepts borrowed from fiat financial derivatives, participants will learn—with real, interactive examples—how to design and create their own decentralized financial contracts that are self-enforcing, permissionless and universally accessible. Participants will learn common design patterns for a wide range of financial products, including contracts for synthetic asset tokenization, decentralized margin trading, and interest rate swaps.

We will also discuss how to implement these design patterns using the Optimistic Financial Contract framework, a new approach to financial contract design that allows for fast, secure, and scalable DeFi contracts. With examples and real-life code, participants will learn how to design new, scalable DeFi products, including a simplified design for a decentralized derivatives exchange (aka a decentralized BitMEX)."
