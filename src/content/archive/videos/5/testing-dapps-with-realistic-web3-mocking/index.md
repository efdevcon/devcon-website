title: "Testing DApps with Realistic Web3 Mocking"
description: "I will demonstrate using a Web3 Mock for UI testing of DApps. It can be difficult to test with actual transactions between the frontend and blockchain. This is because transactions must be signed by a private key, but UI testing frameworks cannot interact with Web3 providers to do so. 
A Web3 Mock solves this problem by signing transactions with a private key automatically and sending them to the blockchain. This offers developers better experiences writing blockchain apps. It uses open source technology and is compatible with a range of blockchain development environments including Ganache, PoA, and remote APIs like Infura. It is integrated with the popular TestCafe platform to perform full end-to-end DApp testing."
