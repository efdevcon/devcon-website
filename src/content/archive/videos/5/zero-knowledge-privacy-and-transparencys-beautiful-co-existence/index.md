title: "Zero Knowledge: Privacy and Transparency's beautiful co-existence"
description: "Zero Knowledge Systems are often imagined as the enabler technologies for a privacy-centric world in which an individual can operate freely, away from public scrutiny. In these proposals, we focus primarily on an individual's right to own and protect their private data. While this is an important topic to us all and a model that is already being explored by projects like Zcash, I believe that the Zero Knowledge paradigm actually offers an opportunity for something even more powerful: that is secure systems providing both privacy and at the same time transparency for individuals and organisations. In this talk, I aim to explore what this balance can look like using zero knowledge systems, how valuable this could be in our personal and business lives, and showcase projects aiming to develop tools in this spirit."
