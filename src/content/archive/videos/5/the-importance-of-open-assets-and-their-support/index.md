title: "The importance of open assets and their support."
description: "The Internet has a lot of open communities supported by goodwill.
Open Source Software, Open Access papers, etc.
But communities that have been supported by goodwill are often questioned about their sustainability.
If the Open Source Software's system was not a massive ecosystem like today, would Ethereum have been born? This problem is still alive.
We considered these communities as \"assets\" and launched a project to create an economy by securitizing.
For assets that previously had no opportunity to be evaluated economically, Ethereum can create its chance.
I want to talk about the importance of the many assets where goodwill are considered to be a single point of failure and our solutions to them."
