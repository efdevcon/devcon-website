title: "Monitoring an Ethereum infrastructure"
description: "Have you ever wondered what goes on under the hood of an Ethereum node? Frankly, most people don't care. If you are, however, running production systems with multiple nodes across geographical locations, knowing what your nodes do internally is more important than you might think.It is a general fallacy to believe that a software either works, or does not. In reality, there is a whole spectrum in between. A software almost never works perfectly, rather there are quirks that may or may not affect your use case. These quirks may manifest only above a certain load or compound as time passes. The only way to build out a robust infrastructure, is to accept that your nodes are quirky. Instead of getting surprised when they break - having no idea what caused it - you must always be aware of buildups and correlations to external stimuli. This talk will present the suite of metrics that Geth exports for monitoring, highlighting why these have been added and why they might be important to you. By correlatinh your own load and use case with Geth's internals, you'll be able to gauge issues before they ever get strained enough to cause catastrophic meltdowns."
