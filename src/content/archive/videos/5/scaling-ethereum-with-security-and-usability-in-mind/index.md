title: "Scaling Ethereum with security and usability in mind"
description: "In this talk, I will go through scaling mechanisms and their disadvantages at a user and developer perspective. With our approach at Matic https://matic.network, plasma-fied sidechain, I will explain how we are tackling security using plasma, predicates, and normal state computation on the sidechain. Having specialized DApp specific fraud-proof using predicates, partial confirmations, different fee models allow us better usability for end users. Then will talk about how we are addressing the issue for users when they interact with multiple chains - Ethereum and Plasma sidechain using walletconnect protocol.  Overall, it explains how connecting some important dots on Ethereum landscape can help us achieve scalability and usability, and clears our path to mass adoption which we all are aiming for."
