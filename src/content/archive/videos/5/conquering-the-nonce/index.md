title: "Conquering the Nonce"
description: "The nonce - just a single, incrementing integer that lets you send your transactions to the Eth network. Simple, right? Our experience working with hundreds of dApp developers tells a very different story - thousands of failing RPC requests, transactions that never get mined, and dozens of hours spent debugging with nothing more to show than a fragile work around. Overlooked and under considered, nonces have been the single biggest pain point for tons of Ethereum developers.

In this talk we will share all of the techniques and best practices weâ€™ve gathered in our hundreds of hours helping DEXs, dApps, and more solve exactly this issue. A few thoughtful design choices and properly handled nonces can lead to better products and significantly higher quality of life for developers."
