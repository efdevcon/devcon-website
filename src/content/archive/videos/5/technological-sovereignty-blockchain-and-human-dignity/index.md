title: "Technological Sovereignty, Blockchain & Human Dignity"
description: "Being aware that the self-determination and freedoms of the peoples of the world will be increasingly linked to technological sovereignty and the preservation of ethnosphere. The Fourth Industrial Revolution challenges us to approach in a multidisciplinary manner the development of Artificial Intelligence, the Blockchain, Robotization and other disruptive technologies so that they are compatible with Human Dignity and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The promotion of democratization and decentralization of technologies, open source software, open data, web neutrality and the adoption of new technologies for the progress and preservation of the tangible and intangible resources of humanity is becoming increasingly necessary. A multidisciplinary response is needed to create pragmatic proposals on the adoption and implementation of the Block Chain in order to preserve human dignity and promote sustainable development.Work at the highest level to advocate the adoption of Blockchain for the preservation of Human Dignity. To adopt this and other emerging technologies, it is necessary to promote a more structured multidisciplinary process of intergenerational cooperation and knowledge management. We build bridges between academia, regulators, civil society and the private sector for the adoption of the Blockchain for the achievement of sustainable development goals and the preservation of ethnosphere."
