title: "A Visual Overview of Blockchain Development"
description: "“The open-source model is a decentralized software development model that encourages open collaboration. Depending on the license terms, others may then download, modify, and publish their version (fork) back to the community.”Yet the ‘open source way’ doesn’t always abide by the rules and many developers just don’t care enough to choose the right license. Arguably, the more than 80 license types scare developers away.
This talk will show us the current state of licenses out in the wild west of open source Ethereum communities- for that, we’ll look at charts, diagrams and maybe even maps- and help you choose an appropriate one when starting a new project."
