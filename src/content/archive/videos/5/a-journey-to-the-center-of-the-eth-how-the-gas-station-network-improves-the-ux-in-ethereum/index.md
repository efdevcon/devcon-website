title: "A journey to the center of the eth: How the Gas Station Network improves the UX in Ethereum"
description: "The Ethereum developer ecosystem is in constant change. Undoubtedly, teams have started to leave the development of Smart Contracts in the background to focus on the development of decentralized applications, and on how to eliminate friction points between users that might not know anything about Blockchain but still need to interact with it. But developer tools are still important and they have to be simple and secure to use. In this talk we will explore how the Gas Station Network is implemented to redefine the interaction between users and DApps in a way that they don't need to have any knowledge on mnemonics, private keys, transactions or gas costs. Moreover, we will go through a set of tools that the OpenZeppelin team developed to make this transition from regular DApps to gasless DApps in a super easy and fast way."
