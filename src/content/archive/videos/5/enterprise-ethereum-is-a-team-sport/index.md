title: "Enterprise Ethereum is a Team Sport"
description: "The World Economic Forum's Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution works with public and private sector around the world to deploy Ethereum solutions in a fair, inclusive and well-designed way and to maximize the benefits for society. From investigating the use of the technology to increase transparency and accountability in government processes to reduce corruption, to encouraging inclusive supply chain deployments to moving ahead decentralized global trade identities. As an impartial party to a number of industry-wide consortium efforts to solve key global issues, it is clear that collaboration, fair and well-designed governance systems are a key barrier to Ethereum adoption. I will shareÂ and explore lessons and insights learnt from existing and in-progress industry consortiums, together with what good consortium collaboration and governance looks like in a decentralized setting.
While the rewards from collaboration can be high, agreeing on what constitutes a fair and well-designed consortia governance system, let alone a joint blockchain platform, can be challenging. This is where many industry collaboration efforts have fallen apart. The presentation will focus on insights to foster industry- and ecosystem-wide blockchain collaboration - to increase the likelihood of success of Enterprise Ethereum adoption and thereby maximize the benefits of blockchain."
