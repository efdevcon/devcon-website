title: "Eth 2.0 light clients: How light is light?"
description: "Ethereum 2.0 has been designed from the ground up to be friendly for \"light clients\" - blockchain clients requiring vastly reduced computational resources that can easily be run in the browser, in embedded devices, and even inside other blockchains! We discuss how light clients work in Eth2.0, why light clients are lighter than full nodes, and get to the bottom of just how \"light\" these clients can be."
