title: "How to make ethereum really trustless?"
description: "Every month, more than 1.5 million smart contracts are published to the blockchain.Every day, more than 1.2 million calls are being made to smart contracts.There are more than 10 million smart contracts on the blockchain already.At the same time, there are less than 1000 publicly verified source codes.Without verified source codes, users who interact with smart contracts directly or through the use of DAPPs, have to trust that the contracts actually do what they promise to do and don't contain any malicious parts.We would like to host a session to discuss how to motivate smart contract creators to publish/verify their source code. Furthermore, we would like to discuss to store verified source code in a decentralized way."
