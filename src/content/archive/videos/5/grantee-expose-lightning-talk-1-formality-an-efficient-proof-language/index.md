title: "Grantee Exposé Lightning Talk 1 - Formality: An efficient proof language"
description: "Formality is a dependently-typed functional programming language similar to Agda that compiles to a non-garbage-collected, parallel runtime based on interaction combinators and Lamping's optimal reduction algorithm. The language is suitable both as a formal proof language as well as a fast low-level systems language, which allows it to be used to write verifiably secure software at every level of the stack, from hardware drivers to smart contracts and everything in between. Formal proofs are of particular interest for smart contracts applications, given that they often have large amounts of capital depending on the safety of relatively small code bases."
