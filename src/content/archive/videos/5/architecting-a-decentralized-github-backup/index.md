title: "Architecting a Decentralized GitHub Backup"
description: "When it comes to building dApps, there is a key part of the process that remains very centralized. The tools we use for version control, like GitHub, are centralized, leaving dApp builders and communities at the mercy of providers and prone to censorship. By building a decentralized backup of GitHub in case of censorship, downtime, or other sudden loss of source code access, dApps can better decentralize access to their codebase. This presentation will outline the architecture behind a decentralized GitHub alternative and demo the proof of concept."
