title: "Ethereum roadmap 2020 EEA Meets With Ethereum Community"
description: "Overview: The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) is interested in growing our relationship with the Ethereum Community and building a bridge for ongoing communication. We invite you to participate in an open forum co-hosted with the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum Magicians, and Ethereum Cat Herders such that EEA can better collaborate to serve users of Ethereum Mainnet. The goal of the workshop is a moderated large-group discussion where everyone in the room feels they have a voice."
