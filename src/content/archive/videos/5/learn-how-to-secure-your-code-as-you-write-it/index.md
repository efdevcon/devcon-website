title: "Learn how to secure your code as you write it"
description: "The Ethereum Virtual Machine and the Solidity language are not trivial components to build with. When you code, you need to consider many more things than with other traditional languages. Things like execution cost, storage and the most importantly: Security.
Also, using a code style guide is a must. It will help any current programmer in a project adhere to the rules pre-established by the team, and enormously help a newcomer avoid some undesired writing styles, impacting on code review quality and speed.
I will introduce you to one of the most used open source linters in the ethereum ecosystem: Solhint.
Solhint allows for detecting syntax-related security code vulnerabilities. Covering a wide range of validation rules, the tool also enables developers to add new ones, while complying with the Solidity style guide and granting 2xâ€“4x boost in performance.
By attending to this workshop you will go through the journey of using Solhint. From integrating it to your preferred IDE all the way down to  get the most out of its functionality.
I will close the workshop sharing best practices that are hard to port - and are still yet to be implemented into Solhint."
