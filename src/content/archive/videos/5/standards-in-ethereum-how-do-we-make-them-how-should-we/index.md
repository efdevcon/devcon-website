title: "Standards in Ethereum - how do we make them, how should we?"
description: "Ethereum, unlike most distributed ledgers, is based on standards, from the Yellow Paper to EIPs. Even the \"corporate\" technology users in the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance build on the Ethereum standards and extend them with their own standards process designed to avoid fragmentation or divergence.
This session will explain the existing standards mechanisms and processes both for Ethereum and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, how they work individually and together, and be a collaborative exploration of what we can do to improve the various standards processes and make sure they produce better outcomes for the ecosystems and the variety of stakeholders that Ethereum serves."
