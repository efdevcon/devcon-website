title: "How much gas does it use interacting with this smart contract?"
description: "Developing a smart contract is easy. There are a lot of tutorials and examples on how to write a smart contract. In some cases, it is even possible to simply copy the code. Afterwards compile it, deploy it and let the users use it. But has it been optimized before the deployment or does it waste the user’s gas?We present a tool which analyzes the bytecode of a deployed smart contract based on the rules presented in Chen et al. (2018): “Towards Saving Money in Using Smart Contracts”. A user can enter a transaction hash and the tool reveals if the smart contract has been optimized. For non-optimized cases the user sees how much gas is wasted by using the functions. The estimation is based on the analysis of the OP codes. Thus, is not necessary to provide the ABI or the source code. This gives users the possibility to verify that smart contracts do not use too much gas and forces developers to optimize their smart contracts."
