title: "Ethereum 2.0 Security Considerations"
description: "Ethereum 2.0 is fast approaching with multiple implementations underway. We examine the attack surface of Eth2, specifically:  
-Networking (eclipse attacks, transport encryption, discovery protocol, anonymity)  
-Software vulnerabilities (DoS, code integrity, inconsistent state transitions)
-Consensus assumptions (honest majority, liveness)
-Efforts underway (fuzzing, code review, external assessments)"
