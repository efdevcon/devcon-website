title: "KWasm: Executable (E)Wasm semantics for verificaton and profit"
description: "KWasm is a project for specifying Wasm in the K framework, much like the EVM was specified with KEVM.Â KEVM has been used extensively for verifying smart contracts, and as Ethereum transitions to Wasm, it's time to get ready to verify Ewasm contracts.
With KWasm complete, the new focus is embedding it into KEwasm and other blockchain execution interfaces. This talk is a quick introduction to the power of K, our roadmap and how you can use KWasm to start verifying Wasm code."
