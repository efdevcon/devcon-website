title: "Deep Dive into WALLETH – the Ethereum Android Wallet"
description: "Devices that run Android are now often one (if not even the only) computer for a lot of users to access many services currently. So to bring Ethereum to the masses and replace current services we need good clients for this platform. WALLETH aims to fill some of this gap. After looking at the surface of in the short talk earlier at the conference: this talk I will dive deeper into WALLETH. Instead of looking from the users side we will look behind the curtains into technical details and development aspects of the project. And I also intend on seeding some ideas in this session – there is so much more possible with this growing codebase and other targets that could be deployed to like Android Things or Chrome-OS."
