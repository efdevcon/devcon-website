title: "Building an Ethereum assisted Decentralized Data Marketplace Breakout"
description: "Data has become a valuable digital currency in its own right over the past decade, but despite its utility, it remains consolidated at the hands of a few large organizations. We propose a new protocol layer for creating an open-access data marketplace. The protocol is decentralized, and allows anyone to publish data in the system in return for incentives. We will discuss the hybrid architecture of the protocol, combining Ethereum smart-contracts for managing data access and subscription, alongside an off-chain network for storing and transmitting the data. Finally, we will introduce Catalyst â€“ the first application to make use of a decentralized marketplace of crypto-data."
