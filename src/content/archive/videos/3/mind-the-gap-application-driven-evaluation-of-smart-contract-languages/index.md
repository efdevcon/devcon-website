title: "Mind the Gap: Application-driven evaluation of Smart Contract languages"
description: "How can we quantify the expressiveness of smart contract programming languages? In this talk Iâ€™ll present research conducted over the past two years that answers this question with an application driven approach. We take several well-known applications as case studies (a random coin flipping gadget, fair off-chain multiparty computations, and payment channel networks), and attempt to implement them in both Bitcoin script (UTXO-based) and in Ethereum (contract-based). In each setting, we find that the UTXO-based framework requires additional asymptotic overhead compared to Ethereum (either time, computing power, or locked-up collateral). These case studies can therefore serve as a benchmark suite for evaluating new languages as well."
