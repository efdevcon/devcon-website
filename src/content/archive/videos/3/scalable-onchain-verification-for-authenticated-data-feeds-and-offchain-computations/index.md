title: "Scalable Onchain Verification for Authenticated Data Feeds and Offchain Computations"
description: "Ethereum smart contracts live like in a walled garden and they cannot fetch offchain data by themselves. One approach to securely feed offchain data into smart contracts is to provide attestation-backed data authenticity proofs that anybody can verify to ensure that the data-transport-layer is safe. By leveraging some new techniques, it is possible to do an effective onchain verification: the smart contract receiving the data can easily verify its authenticity onchain at a negligible cost and with a minimum amount of data."
