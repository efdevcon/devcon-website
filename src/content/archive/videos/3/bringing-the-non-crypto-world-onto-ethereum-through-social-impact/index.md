title: "Bringing the Non Crypto World onto Ethereum Through Social Impact"
description: "Alice is a decentralised social impact network built on Ethereum. It incentivises social organisations to run their projects transparently, so that funders can identify and scale those that are truly effective. We will share our experience (and the challenges) of getting our first application – a hyper transparent donation platform aimed at a mass/non-crypto audience – into production. We’ll also present the work we’re doing with large financial institutions and charities, and the future of the Alice network."
