title: "Scalable Secure Scuttlebutt"
description: "secure-scuttlebutt is a secure gossip protocol with efficient data replication. This talk is about how efficient that data replication is. In the blockchain world, the first goal is global consensus â€“ secure scuttlebutt throws this out the window, and goes for eventual consistency and local consensus, and that frees us up to get really great efficiency. Fortunately there are many useful and important things you can build without global consensus (for example, social networks, and things strapped onto social networks) and these usually benefit greatly from efficiency."
