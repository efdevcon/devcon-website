title: "Kleros: Building a decentralized court system to arbitrate smart contracts"
description: "Smart contracts can’t take decisions requiring outside-world information and subjectivity. However they are a great tool to enforce those decisions. We explain how by drawing jurors at random and providing them proper game-theoretical incentives based on Schellingcoin principles we can design a trustless arbitration mechanism for smart contracts."
