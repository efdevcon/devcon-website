title: "Introducing the TrueBit Virtual Machine"
description: "This talk will focus the economic and architectural mechanics behind TrueBit, a trustless, general purpose computer which obliterates Ethereumâ€™s gas limit. By wrapping the new TrueBit Virtual Machine (TVM) inside a novel incentive structure, smart contracts achieve secure, scalable, and affordable computation. Decentralized big data applications loom on the horizon."
