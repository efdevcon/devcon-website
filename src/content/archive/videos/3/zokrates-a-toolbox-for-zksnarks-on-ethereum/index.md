title: "ZoKrates â€“ A Toolbox for zkSNARKs on Ethereum"
description: "Scalability and confidentiality remain two important challenges in the context of the Ethereum Blockchain. zkSNARKs promise to address these challenges, but they are notoriously complex and hard to use. To help bridge the gap between theory and practice, this talk will introduce ZoKrates: a toolbox for zkSNARKs on Ethereum, making zkSNARKS easier to use. This talk elaborates on the vision, features and design of ZoKrates as well as future steps."
