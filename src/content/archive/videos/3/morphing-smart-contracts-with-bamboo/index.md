title: "Morphing Smart Contracts with Bamboo"
description: "An Ethereum contract language called Bamboo mitigates common mistakes. A Bamboo program textually displays all states and transitions. A program runs always one-pass without loops or functions. Runtime checks never allow reentrant execution. Erlang folks might like the syntax. OCaml people, I need you."
