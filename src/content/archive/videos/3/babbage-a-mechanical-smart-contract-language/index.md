title: "Babbage: A mechanical smart contract language"
description: "In textual programming languages it is often almost impossible to see how different parts interact and fit together. Babbage is a visual programming language that consists of simple mechanical parts that aims to be understandable even by untrained people. Since interacting components have to be physically close, modularity is already guaranteed by design. The goal of Babbage is not to make it easy to create smart contracts, but to make it possible to create smart contracts whose functionality is easy to explain and understand."
