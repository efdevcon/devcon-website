title: "The Colony Reputation Protocol: a verifiable, scalable reputation system"
description: "Colony relies on a broad reputation system to facilitate governance and decision making. The reputation system we are building is far more complex than anything that could be done in a smart contract alone. Instead the system overcomes scalability/gas cost limitations with off-chain computation of the reputation scores which are provable on-chain to the contract. In this talk we will describe how this off-chain calculation with on-chain verifiability is designed and game theoretically secured. We will also describe what kind of actions in a Colony will earn you reputation, and how reputation is used in our collective decision making process."
