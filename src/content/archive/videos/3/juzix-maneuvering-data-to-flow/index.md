title: "Juzix: Maneuvering Data to Flow"
description: "Juzix (formerly Juzhen Financials) is an infrastructure provider for distributed data exchange using distributed ledger technology and multi-party computation. We started out as a financial infrastructure provider in 2014 and have now expanded to other industries interested in adopting distributed data processing and collaborative computation to enable secure data exchange. Juzix currently has over 100 employees, and working with the leading institutions in China to release the first open-source platform using Ethereum that comply with local standards and regulations in China. Version 1.0 (Chinese) will be released in July, 2017, and we think this will enable more Chinese institutions and start-ups to use Ethereum."
