description: "Reentrancy is one of the first lessons learned when getting started with smart contract development and security. In this lightning talk we will present a novel form of reentrency, the \"read-only reentrency\" which is mostly unknown, although devastating in today's DeFi world and which has been single-handedly responsible for $100m+ in funds at risk."
