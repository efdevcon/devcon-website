title: "A Breakdown of Ethereum Supply Distribution Since Genesis"
description: "As Ethereum looks ahead to its transition to a fully to a proof-of-stake consensus protocol, the topic of Ethereum’s supply distribution matters more than ever to network stakeholders. This is because under PoS, the amount of ETH users control directly determines how much influence they can have over the network’s consensus building process and the amount of rewards they can earn from staking. This talk dives into how distributed ETH supply on Ethereum has become over the last 7 years."
