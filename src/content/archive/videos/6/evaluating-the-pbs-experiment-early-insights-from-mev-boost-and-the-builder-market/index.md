title: "Evaluating the PBS Experiment: Early insights from MEV-Boost and the Builder Market"
description: "PBS is a major change to the core Ethereum protocol. It attempts to minimise negative effects of MEV by delegating block building to a market of block builders. This talk would cover what we have learned from the rollout of mev-boost, focusing on what is happening in the builder market, and what this means for the future of in-protocol PBS. What are the main improvements that we can make to the PBS design in response to how this prototype version is performing?"
