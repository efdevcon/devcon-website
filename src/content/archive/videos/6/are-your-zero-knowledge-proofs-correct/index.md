title: "Are Your Zero-Knowledge Proofs Correct?"
description: "Recent efforts have made it possible to write zero-knowledge proofs without having deep expertise in cryptography. Nevertheless, these proofs can be subtly wrong and result in situations where the application erroneously “verifies” bogus information from an attacker. In this talk, we will give an overview of our research that can be used to reason about the correctness of zero-knowledge proofs and highlight some of the open-source tools that Veridise has developed to find bugs in ZK circuits."
