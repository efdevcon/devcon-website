title: "Fixing the Internet with Layer 2 Governance"
description: "Web3 opens the door to a new cyberspaceâ€”one not only occupied, but governed, by its citizens.
[The Optimism Collective](http://optimism.io/vision) is our attempt to correct meatspace's market failures with an L2.
But this talk isn't on scaling. It's about...
...the past: why Ethereum is not an opportunity, but a responsibility.
...the present: what we're doing to take this seriously & how it impacts our governance designs.
...the future: the path towards summoning Ether's Phoenix."
