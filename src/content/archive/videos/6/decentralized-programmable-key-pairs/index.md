description: "Join this talk to get an introduction to Decentralized Programable Key Pairs (PKPs), by Lit Protocol.

PKPs are 'distributed custody cloud wallets' that act as a personal compute platform that can write to a variety of state machines (e.g Ethereum, IPFS) because they are 'smart contracts with a secret' that can make arbitrary HTTP requests and use that data in the computation."
