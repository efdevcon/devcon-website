title: "Time-locked Recovery Factors for Secret Sharing"
description: "Verifiable delay encryption allows us to construct time-locked secret shares which reveal themselves after some time. Paired with share refreshing, this allows users to automatically recover their account after a set amount of time even if they have lost secret shares, without compromising key security. Setup requires no user input which allows for a streamlined UX, and we show a demo of this functionality by generating and recovering a private key using this technique."
