title: "Amplifying Consensus Participation with Blockspace Markets"
description: "In order to maximize staking participation post-merge, we need to provide capital markets for blockspace demand.

This can come in the form of Yield Tokenization (e.g. Swivel, Element), blockspace reservations (e.g. Eden Network), or direct exchanges (e.g. Alkimiya), however composable infrastructure is necessary.

With composable infrastructure on the capital markets layer, we can create interesting instruments such as combined staking+lending+options products, and derivative stablecoins."
