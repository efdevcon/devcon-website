title: "Rollups, Shards & Fractals: The Dream of Atomically Composable Horizontal Scaling"
description: "Rollups allow blockchain to scale vertically, while preserving their trust properties. But what do we do when we reach the limits of vertical scalability? It might also be desirable to accomodate multiple rollups with different operating rules, virtual machines, or security trade-offs. Horizontal scaling solves these issues, but doesn't allow atomic composability. In this talk, we review approaches to horizontal scalability & ways to get as close to atomic composability as possible."
