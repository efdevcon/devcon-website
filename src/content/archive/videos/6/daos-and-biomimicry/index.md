title: "DAOs and Biomimicry"
description: "The talk would essentially be a distilled version of this piece I wrote around biomimicry and DAOs/coordination/governance https://pop.mirror.xyz/NbNlmtjw3hTzVHiCU9dBjcgFDxpD91UY8DOtl5Ht_x0
My general view I would like to impart with the audience is that what we collectively work towards should be rooted in balance, non extremist behaviour and mindfulness - with concrete examples of the work I have already done in practice across Gitcoin DAO, ENS and soon Element."
