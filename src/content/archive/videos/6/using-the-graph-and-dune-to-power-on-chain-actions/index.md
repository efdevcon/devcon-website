title: "Using The Graph and Dune to Power on Chain Actions"
description: "Indexing protocols like The Graph and Dune analytics are great for getting insights on application-specific protocols. However, most are used strategic planning rather than being directly actionable. This workshop teaches developers how to make these insights actionable, by building simple programs in 3 steps:
1. Fetching indexed data streams from public data providers 2. Passing streams through models to generate signals 3. Generating and submitting transactions based on those signals"
