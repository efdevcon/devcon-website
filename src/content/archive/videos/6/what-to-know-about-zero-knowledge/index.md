title: "What to know about Zero Knowledge"
description: "Zero Knowledge, aka ZK, has become a catch-all term to represent much of \"modern\" or \"advanced\" cryptography -- especially cryptography that's relevant to the future of blockchains. 
In this panel, we will share our perspectives on ZK -- how to think about it, what to look out for, and what to focus in on. We'll also discuss how ZK may alter and complement Ethereum's own future."
