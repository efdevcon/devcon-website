title: "Hunting and Monitoring for On-Chain Attacks"
description: "Web3 security requires a comprehensive security approach from reuse of secure, audited libraries, audits, threat modeling and security assessments to bug bounties, monitoring, and incident response.
In this workshop, we will dissect a real world on-chain attack, categorize each step the attacker took into four distinct stages (funding, preparation, exploitation, and money laundering) and walk through the development of a heuristic/ ML approach to identify these attacks using the Forta Network."
