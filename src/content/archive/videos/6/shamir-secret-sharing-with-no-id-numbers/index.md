title: "Shamir Secret Sharing with No ID Numbers!"
description: "Recall that, when splitting a seedphrase via Shamir Secret Sharing into n shares, each share is numbered (from 1 to n). These ID numbers are necessary for reconstructionâ€”if they are lost, reconstruction may be impossible or require brute force.
We will quickly review Shamir Secret Sharing and show a trick that can be used to encode the ID numbers into each share for BIP-39 compliant seeds, so that users only need to store the share mnemonic."
