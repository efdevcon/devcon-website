title: "Sign in With Ethereum: the Most Powerful Protocol in #Web3?"
description: "Sign in with Ethereum is an almost accidental byproduct of #Web3, but is already turning into an incredibly powerful tool for user engagement and convenience.

Linking seams of rich data to an ethereum address is the future of identity, ease and monetisation on the web.   Join Lang Cui (Struck Capital), Nick Johnson (ENS) Justina Petraitytė (3boxx) & Shiv Malik (Pool Data)"
