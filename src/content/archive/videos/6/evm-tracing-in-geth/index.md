title: "EVM Tracing in Geth"
description: "Geth comes with a variety of ways to analyze the execution of past and constructed transactions. In addition to the collection of built-in tracers, users can submit scripts in JavaScript or Go which hook to the EVM, receiving minute events such as \"opcode executed\" or \"entered new call frame\". In the workshop, the audience can follow along a summary of basic tracing, commonly faced problems, as well as an introduction to the more recently shipped features and how to write efficient tracers."
