title: "Building Secure Contracts: Use Echidna Like a Pro"
description: "In this workshop, attendees will gain hands-on experience with Echidna - an open-source smart contract fuzzer - to build secure smart contracts. Echidna has been used in many professional audits, and fuzzing is a key component to increasing the contractsâ€™ security. Attendees will learn how to define and write invariants and how to use Echidna efficiently. By the end of the session, they will know how to integrate property testing into their development process and write more secure code."
