title: "ZK Proof Performance and Security Characteristics"
description: "ZK tech gets almost mystifying treatment from both regular users & devs. However, beyond the moon math, quantifiable differences between the zkps deployed in the Ethereum ecosystem can help users and builders understand what they are interacting with. Join me as I explain our methodology for collecting and quantifying these differences in a format digestible for the non-math professor."
