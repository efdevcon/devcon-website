title: "Validator Receipts: an Alternative to Liquid Staking Derivatives"
description: "Liquid staking derivatives are exciting and powerful, however come with centralization risk and the dangers of holding a derivative rather than its underlying asset.  Validator receipts present an alternative mechanism by which Ether locked in staking can be used as collateral without exposure to derivatives or loss of control of the validating funds."
