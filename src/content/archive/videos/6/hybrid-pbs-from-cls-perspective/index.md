title: "Hybrid PBS from CL's Perspective"
description: "The talk seeks to address the following questions:

- Why does PBS matter from CL's point of view? What happens if we completely ignore it on the protocol layer? What if we wait to release it?
- How did we implement hybrid PBS on CL clients from history to functional products?
- What do they look like in code?
- What are the gotchas and the trade-offs?
- What are the remaining questions we shall seek before moving to full PBS?"
