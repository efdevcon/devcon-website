title: "On the Future of Web3 â€” Paving the Way to End-to-End Fully-Decentralized Web"
description: "One key feature of Web3 is decentralized compared to the current Web2, which is controlled by a few centralized companies such as Facebook, Google. However, when 99% of the users interact with the blockchain, one critical problem shows up: the dApp servers / NSPs are centralized! In this talk, we propose a solution for the future of Web3: an End-to-End Fully Trustless Decentralized Web, which means that any components in our Web2 from the user side and server side will be decentralized in Web3."
