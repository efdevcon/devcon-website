title: "The Original Sin"
description: "No one expected MetaMask's userbase to grow from 300k to over 30 million during this last bull run. It was an incredibly optimistic time filled with boundless creativity but it was also a chaotic time that led to many having a negative experience with web3.
With the market cooling and the merge complete, let's look at how the early choices at the protocol layer shaped the user experience today and identify what's worth changing for the user experience tomorrow."
