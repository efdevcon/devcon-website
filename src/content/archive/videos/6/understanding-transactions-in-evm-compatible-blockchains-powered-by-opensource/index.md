title: "Understanding Transactions in EVM-Compatible Blockchains Powered by Opensource"
description: "Transactions are stored in the blockchain as hexadecimal data. That may be ok if you are a shadowy super coder but if you are like the rest of us you just need to have them explained in English. If there are no tools that allow decoding of those transactions then the potential of web3 can not be realized
Its crucial such tools are developed in the open, as opensource code since decoding events for different chains and protocols scale faster than what any team of developers can maintain alone"
