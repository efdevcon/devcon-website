title: "Shielded Voting Using Threshold Encryption"
description: "Shutter Governance is a tool for governance platforms to introduce shielded voting for their users. It uses threshold encryption and is designed to fix issues with misbehavior, voter apathy, and voting incentive.

Simply put, with Shutter Governance, votes are encrypted during the voting period. The votes are decrypted and thereby only revealed after the poll closes.

The talk will include a live demo of Shielded Voting as developed in partnership with Snapshot."
