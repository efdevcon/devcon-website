title: "1 Human 1 Vote Money Legos üîú More Democratic DAOs üß±ü§ù‚ú®"
description: "Right now, the DAO ecosystem is built around one-token-one-vote or one-cpu-one-vote schemes.
With strong sybil resistence, the ecosystem could move to DAOs built on one-human-one-vote. This unlocks more democratic use cases like:
- quadratic funding - quadratic voting - Gini coefficient measurements - UBI - one-person-one-vote DAOs - data collectives - sybil resistant airdrops + more
Learn about the current landscape of sybil resistance techniques in web3."
