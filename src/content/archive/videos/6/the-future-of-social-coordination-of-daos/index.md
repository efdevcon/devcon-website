title: "The Future of Social Coordination of DAO's"
description: "We build tools to make it easy for projects to align the incentives of all stakeholders (community, VC's, team members, users etc etc). The direction of the talk will be to talk through the lessons we learnt, how other DAO's and teams can take the success stories to their own projects and give an overview of the aspects of what we did that worked. This talk will also go through the experience that have not worked and a critical view of why they did not."
