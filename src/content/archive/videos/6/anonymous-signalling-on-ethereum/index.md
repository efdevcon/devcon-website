title: "Anonymous Signalling on Ethereum"
description: "Semaphore is a protocol, designed to be a simple and generic privacy layer for Ethereum DApps. Using zero knowledge, Ethereum users can prove their membership of a group and send signals such as votes or endorsements without revealing their original identity. The talk will describe the protocol, the main concepts and some use cases. A simple demo will also likely be used to show how Semaphore can be used to create DApps and solve real problems in the ecosystem."
