title: "Social Composability Design: How DAOs Can Leverage It for the Future of Work"
description: "Effective communication is a strategic advantage that DAOs are failing to leverage due to a fragmented and inefficiently designed tool landscape. Let's explore how social web3 primitives may unlock collaborative network effects. Imagine knowing if you can trust someone at a glance, without knowing anything else about them. We'll tie social theory of Bourdieu together with User Experience Design into a neat little package and see how it can herald a new era in working together."
