description: "Web3 is mostly a desktop experience, but we spend most of our time on mobile devices. How can we bridge the gap between Dapps and Mobile, especially in such a crucial step as the wallet connection? In this talk, we want to share the failures and learnings we had while developing GM Shop, the first tokengated experience built for mobile that partnered with the biggest NFT brands such as Doodles, Invisible Friends, and Cool Cats."
