title: "Crosschain Security Considerations for the Degen in All of Us"
description: "Crosschain applications (xApps) are often considered too risky, but this viewpoint is divorced from reality. People **will** use these applications and it is our responsibility to understand the security implications. xApp developers must be able to reason about concurrency and asynchrony across two different networks, as well as understand the trust assumptions introduced by the data transport layer. By understanding this, we can allow users to engage in risky behavior in the safest way."
