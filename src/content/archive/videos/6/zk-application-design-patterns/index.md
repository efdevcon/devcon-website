title: "ZK Application Design Patterns"
description: "We build a brief mental model of zkSNARKs and give an overview of application design patterns and techniques for ZK-enabled apps. We discuss the overall landscape of proving environments and applications of each: the affordances of browser proving, mobile proving, server proving, GPU proving, etc. We'll go over the current state of the art and key benchmarks, and how improvements across the landscape can unlock new applications of both privacy and succinctness."
