title: "The Unbanked, A Real Blue Ocean Opportunity for Crypto"
description: "1/4 of the global population is excluded from the current financial system. Financial exclusion stems from the belief that a population is too high risk to receive funding. Sadly, this factor preeminently causes these same people to never be able to break out of poverty.

Unbanked farmers fall in the same boat. Due to their lack of collateral and credit history, they can only access loans starting at 100% interest rate. Crypto and blockchain has an opportunity to change that for the better."
