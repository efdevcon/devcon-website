title: "Non-interactive, Unique Nullifiers: The Key to The Next Era of ZK"
description: "ZK app systems are being held back because there isn't an anonymous way to prove that you aren't double claiming/double posting. In this talk, we explore the variety of nullifiers and present a new signature scheme that would enable things like zk airdrops or other zk systems that require uniqueness."
