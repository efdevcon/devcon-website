title: "Advanced Seaport Techniques"
description: "Seaport is a marketplace protocol for buying and selling NFTs. While it powers OpenSea in a horizontal capacity, Seaport is open source and allows marketplaces to share a pool of liquidity – enabling project-specific, bespoke vertical marketplaces. Since launch, it’s helped spur innovation across emerging NFT verticals, including ENS names, in-game purchases, etc. This workshop will explore advanced techniques and use cases for the Seaport protocol."
