title: "State of the ENS"
description: "An overview of ENS's innovations and progress in the last couple of years. Learn about how the ENS DAO is developing new approaches to decentralised governance, and how the development of ENS's offchain infrastructure makes trustless access to data held outside L1 easier for everyone - enabling both ENS's expansion to L2s and much broader applications."
