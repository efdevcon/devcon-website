title: "Why Account Abstraction is a Game-Changer for Dapps"
description: "Native account abstraction on L2 is a breakthrough for the usability and security of crypto. It’s also the only way to scale self-custody. This talk explains what account abstraction is and why it matters for Dapps and their users. We’ll provide specific examples of features that it uniquely enables, such as session keys, fraud monitoring, multicall, social recovery and more. The end result is the unlocking of new experiences and use cases that can move the needle for crypto’s adoption."
