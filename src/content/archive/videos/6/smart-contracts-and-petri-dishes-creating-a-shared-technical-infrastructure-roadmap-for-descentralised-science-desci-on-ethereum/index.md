title: "Smart Contracts and Petri Dishes: Creating a Shared Technical Infrastructure Roadmap for Descentralised Science (DeSci) on Ethereum"
description: "DeSci is the combination of open science principles and decentralization. This workshop aims to unite founders and developers in the DeSci ecosystem to explore what infrastructure is needed: from reputation systems for scientific credentials, to file storage, public good funding and financialisation. Participants will actively determine pressing needs and a roadmap to functioning DeSci dapps, while also exploring the cultural complexity and UX of scientists as a user group."
