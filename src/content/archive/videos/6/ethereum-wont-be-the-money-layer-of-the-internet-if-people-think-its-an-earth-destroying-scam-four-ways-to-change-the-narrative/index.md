description: "2021 was the breakout year for web3. Yet despite the millions of new users, a Morning Consult survey found that while 83% of consumers are aware of crypto, only 26% have a positive opinion. How do we as a community shift the narrative? I will share four ways to communicate web3’s benefits, relying on insight from our survey of 20k people in 15 countries around the world, updates on MetaMask Learn, and the inspiring stories of creativity and entrepreneurship enabled through web3."
