title: "Lodestar: Metrics-Driven Development"
description: "Lodestar is the newest production-ready consensus client, written entirely in TypeScript.
How did we do it? How did we go from buggy, slow, and scared to agile, confident chads? Metrics, metrics, metrics!
We will introduce the concept of metrics-driven development in the context of blockchain node development and give fun examples where metrics saved our hide, time and time again."
