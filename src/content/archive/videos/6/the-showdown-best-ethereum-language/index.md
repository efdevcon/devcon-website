title: "The Showdown: Best Ethereum Language"
description: "This session will be an unconventional panel discussion. Instead of being boring and repeating the same things, we will spice things up a bit.
The goal is to decide which is the best language for Ethereum.
How do we find that out? Though a combination of \"pub quiz\" and on-stage activity (e.g. tug-of-war) between members of different language teams. The audience can chime in as well."
