title: "Practical Pluralism ♻️🌱"
description: "Pluralism — the understanding that diversity of people, beliefs, opinions, mechanisms, approaches, implementations, etc within a given context generally results in better outcomes than in the absence of such diversity. 
In this lightning talk, Regen Web3 Founders Trent Van Epps, Abbey Titcomb, Karl Flouresch, Kevin Owocki, Griff Green, and Auryn MacMillan will talk about how they're baking pluralism into their projects + building a more pluralistic world by doing so."
