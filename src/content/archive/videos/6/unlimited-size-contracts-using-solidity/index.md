title: "Unlimited Size Contracts Using Solidity"
description: "Ethereum currently have a limit of 24KB for a contract size which cause a major pain for many Solidity devs. I would present all available options to address this issue using Solidity language during the workshop and provide cons and pros of them.
* External libs
* Transparent and uups proxies
* EIP-2535
* Static precompiled router proxy 
* Dynamic router
I will also provide gas optimization tricks for above methods and a novel method to reduce a gas cost for unlimited size contracts."
