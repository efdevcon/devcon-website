title: "Unlimited Size Contracts Using Solidity"
description: "Ethereum currently have a limit of 24KB for a contract size which cause a major pain for many Solidity devs. I would present all available options to address this issue using Solidity language during the workshop and provide cons and pros of them. * External libs * Transparent and uups proxies * EIP-2535 * Static precompiled router proxy  * Dynamic router I will also provide gas optimization tricks for above methods and a novel method to reduce a gas cost for unlimited size contracts."
