description: "To maximize the real-world utility of the Ethereum network, ether and ERC20 stablecoins must be increasingly used as money. This means being able to pay for goods and services without going through exchanges or banks. This talk will give a short history of the best efforts so far at onboarding merchants, dive into the anthropological reasons why this is a hard problem, and share our learnings on some recent successes on growing the number of crypto consumer purchases."
