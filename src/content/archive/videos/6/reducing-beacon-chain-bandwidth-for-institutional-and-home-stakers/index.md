title: "Reducing Beacon Chain Bandwidth for Institutional and Home Stakers"
description: "This talk gives an overview of the networking infrastructure of beacon nodes and details some of the recent research being done significantly reduce the growing bandwidth requirements of the Ethereum consensus layer. In particular, we will discuss the network requirements of gossipsub, how long-lived subnets can be the cause and a potential solution to high bandwidth usage as well as preliminary results from experiments with an experimental extension to the gossipsub protocol, episub."
