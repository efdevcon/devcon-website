title: "Building Parallel Economy Using Ethereum"
description: "Ethereum is one of the most important tools enabling us to build free parallel structures. Parallel Polis is a humanitarian concept popularized by Czechoslovak dissidents and carried on by cryptoanarchists and cypherpunks in recent years. From their experience of living solely in cryptoeconomy for past 8 years, we learn how Ethereum is an irreplaceable tool for crypto native life, business and social structures."
