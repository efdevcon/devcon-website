title: "Ethereum is Solarpunk ☀️"
description: "Solarpunk is an art movement that envisions how the future might look if humanity succeeded in solving major contemporary challenges with an emphasis on sustainability problems such as climate change and pollution.
Solarpunk is our alternative to doomerism. … We just need a key that unlocks the building of new institutions -- Humanity Coordinating at Webscale.
Ethereum is Solarpunk - a key to coordinating humanity through it's coordination failures."
