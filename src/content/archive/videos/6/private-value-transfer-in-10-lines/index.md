title: "Private Value Transfer in 10 Lines"
description: "Demonstration of how drawing from a standard cryptographic library can reduce zero knowledge circuit implementations to simple programs of as few as 3 lines.
The Join split circuit is a popular circuit that originated from Zcash and is being used in Aztec. Using the Aztec Noir standard library, we reconstruct the join split in 10 lines hiding all of the circuit complexities involved."
