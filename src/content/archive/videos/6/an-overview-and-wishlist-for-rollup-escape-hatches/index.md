title: "An Overview and Wishlist for Rollup Escape Hatches"
description: "Escape hatches are meant to be a way to exit assets or state from a rollup in the hopefully unlikely event that sequencers are offline. In this talk, we review which projects have these hatches and what plans are publicly available for future rollups or versions of these rollups. We list some ideas that these, and other rollups, may implement or adopt in the future, for more robust and secure rollups. The suggestions will be rooted in our concern for security and the issues presented by bridges."
