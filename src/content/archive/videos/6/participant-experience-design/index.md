title: "Participant Experience Design"
description: "User experience design is traditionally focused on driving user engagement and behaviors that serve business goals. How do goals and processes change when designing for commons or public goods? How does conventional design wisdom help us, and when can it lead us astray? What new patterns, strategies or challenges emerge when we consider the user as a participant rather than a customer?"
