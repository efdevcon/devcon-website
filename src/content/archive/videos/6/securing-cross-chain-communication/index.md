title: "Securing Cross-chain Communication"
description: "The last year witnessed several cross-chain bridges being hacked and millions of dollars stolen by hackers. Despite the bridges having gone through several audits, we still see them getting exploited because hackers were able to get access to authorized private keys, signature replay attacks, etc. Let us see what a secure cross-chain bridge architecture should look like and what are the possible attack vectors and mitigation techniques."
