title: "Technical Details of the Opcode Compatible zkEVM"
description: "I will explain some technical details on how we, at PolygonHermez, built the opcode compatible zkEVM. This will include some design details of specific pieces like the storage, the arithmetic state machine, the keccak circuit, among others.  I will also go thru some snippets of the zkASM code that emulates the Ethereum VM.  
I will include in the talk some performance measures and I will do a live demo of the testnet."
