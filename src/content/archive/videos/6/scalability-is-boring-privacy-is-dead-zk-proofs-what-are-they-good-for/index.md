title: "Scalability is Boring, Privacy is Dead: ZK-Proofs, What are They Good for?"
description: "The first mainstream uses of zero-knowledge(zk) proofs were for private payments in systems like Zcash and then scalability. In both, we hide data to improve privacy or validation costs. But private payments, unfortunately, have seen limited direct demand. And scalability needs faster proofs but not even zero-knowledge. What are practical zk proofs good for? This talk considers zk proofs + blockchains as a tool both for cryptocurrency and broader applications."
