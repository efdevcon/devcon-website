title: "dm3 - Decentralized, Secure and Open Messaging Protocol"
description: "dm3 is a protocol enabling decentralized, open, and secure messaging based on established web3 services like ENS and IPFS. It doesn't rely on any central service. The user has complete control over where their messaging data is stored. By using ENS names and ENS text records as the registry for public keys, the user owns the identity linked to their messages. dm3 comes with a reference implementation for a standalone web application, a widget, and a delivery service."
