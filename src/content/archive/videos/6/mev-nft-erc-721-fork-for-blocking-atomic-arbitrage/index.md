title: "MEV NFT: ERC-721 Fork for Blocking Atomic Arbitrage"
description: "Inspiration
MEV (miner extractable value) is an issue that often times disbenefits the smaller consumers or traders. While traditional MEV research is mostly focussed on sandwich trades, we focus on one specific type of extractable value: MEV NFT!

Let's illuminate the dark forest.

In the talk we present a novel way to analyse and detect NFT arbitrage for more transparency. With that research we design a ERC-721 token that blocks malicious bots and could benefit consumers."
