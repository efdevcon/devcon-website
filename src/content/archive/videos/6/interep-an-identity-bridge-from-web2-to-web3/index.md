title: "Interep: An Identity Bridge from Web2 to Web3"
description: "Interep aims to provide an identity solution for Ethereum users by bridging from an established digital identity source, typically a web2 platform. The product provides an identity layer in an application stack, and integrates with a privacy-focussed layer using the Semaphore framework. Interep can be used to to qualify users, or as an anti-sybil service."
