title: "Ups and Downs: Onboarding a Million Users to Layer-2"
description: "In the last year we’ve seen thousands of projects and billions of dollars migrate over to rollups. Liquidity and users have started aggressively migrating, but there’s still a long way to go. In this talk we’ll cover successful use cases, pain points that make it challenging for both users and developers to onboard, and emerging projects and protocols in the layer 2 space that are showing a lot of promise."
