      description: "Proof of stake and sharding present two of the biggest upcoming milestones in the ongoing development of the Ethereum protocol. Proof of stake offers the promise to greatly reduce the cost of consensus and increase security guarantees, while sharding presents an approach to allow on-chain scaling to tens of thousands of transactions per second while still retaining a network that can, if needed, run on nothing but a sufficiently large set of consumer laptops. The Casper approach to proof of stake also introduces a number of novel concepts, including consensus-by-bet and fork choice by value-at-loss."

      description: "This presentation focuses on how Zcash uses zero-knowledge proofs to add private transactions to a public blockchain, and how Zcash and Ethereum will grow together. Zcash is a new cryptocurrency that provides private transactions — the sender’s and receiver’s addresses are not publicly visible in the blockchain, nor is the amount transferred. Zcash posts that private information to the blockchain in encrypted form, and uses zero-knowledge proofs to cryptographically guarantee the validity of transactions without exposing the private information. This results in “Selective Transparency”. It’s not all-dark-all-the-time — it’s that each encrypted transaction in the blockchain can be revealed by its creator to selected third parties. Zcash is developed by a VC-funded, highly skilled development team and a widespread and active open source community. There are three paths forward for integrating Ethereum’s programmability with Zcash’s privacy. The Zcash team is actively contributing to all three paths. 1. Programmable Zcash — add Ethereum-style programmability to the Zcash blockchain 2. Private Ethereum — add Zcash-style privacy to the Ethereum blockchain 3. Project Alchemy — interoperation between the Ethereum and Zcash"

The principle is to collect the computer resources underutilized on the Internet to execute very large parallel applications at the fraction of the cost of a traditional supercomputer. Since the early 2000’s we have pushed this idea to its extreme limit by proposing many software and algorithms in the area of large scale data processing, data management, parallel computing, security and dependability, QoS,… iExec relies on XtremWeb-HEP, a mature, solid, and open-source Desktop Grid software which implements all the needed features : fault-tolerance, multi-applications, multi-users, hybrid public/private infrastructure, deployment of virtual images, data management, security and accountability, interoperability with eScience infrastructure, and many more. In this talk, we’ll show how Ethereum can be used to organize decentralised infrastructures and market places, where everyone will be able to rent its computing resources (CPU, storage, GPU, …), where the innovative SMEs which design Big Data and HPC applications will be able to sell them online immediately with the needed resources to run them, and where highly valued data-sets will be rentable with a fine-grain business model. We’ll present some early results that illustrate the interaction between the Ethereum blockchain and regular distributed systems (e.g task scheduler, data management, etc..) Moreover, because the blockchain provides distributed consensus and resiliency while being fully distributed, we think that it’s going to change drastically the way we design distributed systems and applications. We’ll draw some perspectives on blockchain-based infrastructure management, and present the related research directions."

Nevertheless, and despite TheDAO experiment, a complete understanding of what exactly a DAO is and how its ticks is still lacking. In this talk I’d like to briefly sketch a comprehensive DAO protocol, enabling decentralised reputation-based collaboration, decision making and value distribution. A scalable implementation of the protocol on the Ethereum blockchain is made possible by introducing a novel software architecture composed of a simple smart contract on the chain, and an off-chain component responsible for the majority of the interactions with the protocol."

      title: "Developing Scalable Decentralized Applications for Swarm & Ethereum"
      featured: false
      description: "Blockchain-coordinated decentralized applications represent a radical departure from the client-server model on which most of the currently popular web applications are based. On one hand, such đapps’ approach to scalability is more natural as the computing power and bandwidth available for applications grows in proportion to their user base, while on the other hand the lack of a centralized trusted infrastructure under the control of a single — typically corporate — entity raises unique challenges in trust, reliability and coordination. In my presentation, I will introduce some of the principles and practices of architecting and developing such applications, highlighting both the challenges and the unique opportunities for transcending the limitations of the client-server model. In addition to developing the underlying infrastructure, the Swarm team also develops some example applications that, while useful themselves for end users, are also meant as a template and a starting point for independent developers. Using these examples as illustrations, the presentation will introduce prospective developers to techniques and approaches of both replicating Web 2.0 patterns in a decentralized fashion and going beyond their limitations, taking full advantage of content-addressed storage and blockchain-arbitrated interactions. In particular, the basic building blocks of decentralized, community-moderated knowledge bases (such as maps or encyclopediae), social networks and other forms of information aggregation are going to be presented."

      featured: false
      description: "Mistaking blockchain for a distributed ledger usually leads to wrong ideas and broken designs. Other technologies should usually be used to implement an immutable ledger. Especially if there is no use for smart contracts or on-chain code, using Ethereum would usually create too much overhead. However, a different use for smart contracts seems to be emerging that may not be along the lines they are currently understood: instead of facilitating self executing agreements and payments, they can be useful for user parametrization of complex workloads. Parameters of a system can ever only be as powerful as the code they are controlling. In platform systems, users will define parameters to control part of a pre-programmed environment in ways that they need it. Parameters often power creep from static values, over macros to full blown scripts. It’s along those lines that Lua developed from a parameter definition language into a powerful script language. Smart contracts seem to leak into a role where they extend the power of digitally signed parameters to trustable scripts, which can allow e.g. for more flexible controlling of the anonymous execution of analysis code against a provided data stream with full transparency for the data provider and execution guarantee for the code provider."

      featured: false
      description: "Swap, Swear and Swindle. Swarm Incentivisation A robust peer-to-peer content storage and retrieval system requires a careful balance between the needs of the service providers and those of the consumers. The Swarm network is uniquely able to address these needs due to the new opportunities ethereum offers in the form of micro payments and smart-contract governed incentive schemes. In this talk we want to introduce the swarm incentive system. It is built around three pillars which we call Swap, Swear and Swindle. The Swap system accounts for bandwidth usage and compensates nodes for serving up content. The dynamics of this system suggest that popular content will automatically become more widely distributed and faster to access. Micropayments are handled by a custom chequebook smart contract and we are actively looking to integrate full payment channels as well. The Swear contracts deal with long term storage, allowing nodes to sell access to their storage capacity while allowing others to reliably store their content on swarm for extended periods of time. Finally, the Swindle contracts constitute a litigation engine to resolve disputes. The properties of Swindle make it a natural candidate to be a state-channel judge contract and we will present our research into off-chain state-channels for proofs-of-custody, recurring payments as well as litigation and conflict resolution. Swarm thus touches upon multiple strands of research currently happening in and around the ethereum ecosystem and unifies them in a coherent narrative that we hope to convey in this talk."

In this talk, I will discuss the three challenges I see ahead for Ethereum, go over known techniques for addressing them, and will identify the future work that needs to be done because of the unique challenges faced by the Ethereum platform. First, we’ll talk about scale, touch upon known techniques for scaling on- and off-chain. Next, we’ll talk about program verification, what it can do, and why it is not the panacea that many people make out to be. In particular, I’ll talk about the kinds of smart contract properties that we know how to ascertain, versus the kinds of smart contract properties that we would ideally like to verify, and discuss the gap between the two. Finally, I’ll talk about the next frontier involving private data and private computation on a public blockchain, a combination thought to be impossible by some, and describe how we can achieve it with the help of secure hardware."

As such, the AION Network is designed to support many custom blockchain architectures, while providing a trustless mechanism for cross-chain interoperability. By utilizing our concept of “bridges”, this multi-tiered blockchain model will allow the creation of layers of connecting blockchain networks that are able to communicate and transact among each other."

This session will cover the progress so far in addressing these issues, as well as our goals and intentions for the semantics moving forward. In particular, we are focused on providing tools to ease the process of writing and proving specifications about programs written in high-level languages. Everett Hildenbrandt is a CS PhD student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying formal methods and programming languages. He is focused on improving the scalability of symbolic reasoning for applications in both distributed and physical systems.

      description: "Devices that run Android are now often one (if not even the only) computer for a lot users to access many services currently. So to bring Ethereum to the masses and replace current services we need good clients for this platform. WALLETH aims to fill some of this gap. Here I will talk about the concepts behind the user-interface and general ideas behind the project. Another area that I want to shed some light on in this talk is the special security properties mobile applications on Android have. We will not have time for much more in this talk but there is also one 30min deep-dive session later in the conference."

The focus of the presentation will be on how allowing data providers, payment providers, and various API-based services to be accessed by Ethereum smart contracts through a decentralized oracle network can greatly expand functionality, while maintaining the key security guarantees of smart contracts. We’ll focus on how TownCrier’s approach to implementing Intel SGX enables third party oracles to be provably secure, as is already being done on production using the currently live TownCrier implementation. We’ll also look at how oracle operations and off-chain computation can be written in solidity to be run entirely in an SGX Enclave, allowing provable off-chain computation and retrieval of external resources. Smart contracts need to retain a high level of security in both the network they run on, and the inputs/outputs they rely on, we aim to show how decentralized oracle networks, TownCrier’s approach to using Intel SGX for secure external access , and off-chain computation using solidity in Intel SGX can together allow smart contracts to remain secure as they access key resources outside the Ethereum network."

We take several well-known applications as case studies (a random coin flipping gadget, fair off-chain multiparty computations, and payment channel networks), and attempt to implement them in both Bitcoin script (UTXO-based) and in Ethereum (contract-based). In each setting, we find that the UTXO-based framework requires additional asymptotic overhead compared to Ethereum (either time, computing power, or locked-up collateral). These case studies can therefore serve as a benchmark suite for evaluating new languages as well."

      featured: false
      description: "In the two years that have passed since the Ethereum blockchain’s genesis block, numerous decentralized applications (dApps) have created Ethereum smart contracts for peer-to-peer exchange. Rapid iteration and a lack of best practices have left the blockchain scattered with proprietary and application-specific implementations. As a result, end users are exposed to numerous smart contracts of varying quality and security, with unique configuration processes and learning curves, all of which implement the same functionality. This approach imposes unnecessary costs on the network by fragmenting end users according to the particular dApp each user happens to be using, destroying valuable network effects around liquidity. We present 0x: an open protocol and shared settlement layer for trustless, low friction exchange of ERC20 tokens."

But as the resources consumed by a blockchain network grows, so is the node cost. Full nodes are usually altruistic, they take resources from their peers and they give back. But there is no immediate benefit to give back. This problem, which can lead to a tragedy of the commons, was early identified in the “Red Balloons” paper. Some solutions involve using master-nodes, leading to centralization risks. In this talk we’ll show how to create a fully decentralized system for rewarding full nodes that is fully autonomous, and controlled by a smart-contract."

Throughout this journey, we have learnt a lot about industry needs, working with both small and large retailers and brands. We’ve also forged partnerships with sustainability standards e.g Soil Association organic and other data systems that we can connect to enable verification of claims and inputs for our Ethereum based app e.g. Sourcemap. User centred design is core to the work at Provenance – exploring how we can make blockchain backed data appear differently on the frontend and provide accessible links to inspect the chain.

      description: "In the two years that have passed since the Ethereum blockchain’s genesis block, numerous decentralized applications (dApps) have created Ethereum smart contracts for peer-to-peer exchange. Rapid iteration and a lack of best practices have left the blockchain scattered with proprietary and application-specific implementations. As a result, end users are exposed to numerous smart contracts of varying quality and security, with unique configuration processes and learning curves, all of which implement the same functionality. This approach imposes unnecessary costs on the network by fragmenting end users according to the particular dApp each user happens to be using, destroying valuable network effects around liquidity. We present 0x: an open protocol and shared settlement layer for trustless, low friction exchange of ERC20 tokens."

The focus of the presentation will be on how allowing data providers, payment providers, and various API-based services to be accessed by Ethereum smart contracts through a decentralized oracle network can greatly expand functionality, while maintaining the key security guarantees of smart contracts. We’ll focus on how TownCrier’s approach to implementing Intel SGX enables third party oracles to be provably secure, as is already being done on production using the currently live TownCrier implementation. We’ll also look at how oracle operations and off-chain computation can be written in solidity to be run entirely in an SGX Enclave, allowing provable off-chain computation and retrieval of external resources. Smart contracts need to retain a high level of security in both the network they run on, and the inputs/outputs they rely on, we aim to show how decentralized oracle networks, TownCrier’s approach to using Intel SGX for secure external access , and off-chain computation using solidity in Intel SGX can together allow smart contracts to remain secure as they access key resources outside the Ethereum network."

(3) Rules of service provision are enforced by a courtroom making nodes accountable in case of non-compliance (swindle)."

The stack is built on top of Ethereum smart contracts which are used for access control, permissioning, and secure licensing payments. Data transport is implemented by a P2P network where nodes are incentivized by payments in DATAcoin, the native token of the project. The network implements scalable, robust and low-latency pub/sub messaging infrastructure for data delivery. The layer above consists of data market where data streams can be showcased and shared between producers and consumers who transact using DATAcoin. Streamr Engine is an event processing and analytics layer capable of reacting to incoming real-time data and taking action. Finally, there is a graphical a visual programming environment where users can easily create data processing systems by connecting modules in a drag-and-drop fashion.

Who is “the Grants Team?” How can this be sustainable? We shine light on the inner-workings of the Grants Program and discuss our vision for the future."

      description: "The ERC 20 had far more impact than I expected when I proposed the draft in November 2015. The massive amounts of ICOs following the adoption of this standard lead to money collection becoming a breeze. As much as this democratised the crowdfunding space, it also led to massive amounts of money being collected by projects that lived not up to the expectation they have created, opening up the door to not ICO-able projects, as well as outright scams.  Its time to bring back balance, by letting participants decide if they deem a project worthy their funding - over time. The RICO, or Reversible ICO is a proposal I introduced a few months back that has the potential to make ICOs more fair. This is done by releasing the funds over time and giving each participant the power to cut his funding to the project at any point in time."

      featured: false
      description: "To mitigate security issues that were quickly evident in the deployment of smart contracts, developers have tried a wide variety of security techniques.  Standard when deploying new contracts is manual review by an externally contracted company/individual, often with verification tools.  In many ways this has been a success, reducing observed security incidents.  In this talk, we take a look at how unique incentives in smart contracts affect the process of securing them. Smart contracts are often non-upgradeable: enshrinement at release encourages security processes that end after a contract is deployed, leaving blind spots in long-term security guarantees against evolving threats.  Pressure to ship often leaves critical guarantees out-of-scope of external reviews, and auditor incentives discourage detailed, fundamental criticisms of contracts'protocols.  We explore flawed mechanisms whose obvious security flaws cost users millions today, even though such flaws are often out of launch audit scope. We empirically quantify the size of this problem, highlighting major issues with all smart contract voting and all decentralized exchange protocols.  We conclude by exploring systemic risk, discussing mechanisms whose flaws could one day go beyond affecting their users to threaten the stability of all dapps.  We conclude with lessons learned for security conscious dapp developers."

We will show how the claims are managed off-chain and validated on-chain and off-chain. We will explain how to generate proofs to validate claims that are valid only for an specific recipient and not reusable.

But up to now Ethereum has been the near-exclusive playpen of a tiny coterie of already-wealthy, never-marginalized, mostly Western and almost entirely male technocrats. Can Ethereum be more than this? Can it fulfill its mission to be the future compute platform for all of humanity? How do we overcome the enormous obstacles we currently face to mass adoption, things such as UX, the complexity of key and identity management, the public perception of scams and shitcoins, and the awful wealth distribution? I believe the answer lies in the concept of social scalability, conceptualized by Nick Szabo. This talk will introduce the concept, discuss how it relates to Ethereum, and examine present scaling, governance, education, marketing, and UX initiatives through this lens, with an eye towards developing Ethereum into a platform usable by and valuable to humans everywhere."

      featured: true
      description: "Many, including Satoshi, believed cryptocurrencies provided privacy for payments. In reality, cryptocurrency is Twitter for your bank account. Worse, the current set of decoy transaction–based approaches commonly believed to provide privacy—including coinjoin and cryptonote/Monero—provide fundamentally flawed privacy protections. Where did we go wrong? This talk covers how to critically evaluate the privacy provided by any proposed protocol for payment privacy. Through a series of thought experiments, it outlines three plausible attacks on existing decoy-based schemes: an “overseer” attack where customers can be tracked across colluding merchants or advertisers, a “flashlight” attack that identifies the real owner of an address intended to anonymously receive funds, and a “tainted dust” attack that allows anyone to see where a target regularly spends their money. These issues show the unintuitive nature of privacy protections, as well as the need to both evaluate protocols in the context of real world threats, and use approaches with formal and peer reviewed privacy guarantees such as Zcash."

The jump operations are a main obstacle for this, because they might require a preservation of all basic blocks in the worst case. To overcome this, Solidity's new optimizer operates on an intermediate language called Yul, which is close to EVM bytecode (and also wasm) but abstracts jump operations through real function calls. Each of the many optimizing operations are simple local equivalence transforms whose effects can be inspected at any time and which in combination should be both more reliable and efficient than the classic optimizer."

Communities that engage with these technologies often frame decentralization as a moral good in and of itself - but to what extent has this claim been validated?  We'll consider examples where censorship resistant networks are used to host content that is morally repugnant to their maintainers, at times when centralized networks are cracking down, cases where there is disagreement about what constitutes decentralization at all, and seeming limits of decentralization. The concept of decentralization appears, at least on the surface, to be the enemy of specialization - but yet the networks we hope to build are the product of specialized knowledge. Can we decentralize the building of decentralized networks themselves?  Ultimately, I hope to make the point that decentralization without governance has few, if any, inherent moral qualities, and that we must consistently and intentionally consider not only how, but why and for whom, we decentralize."

Policies don't occur in a vacuum. Bad policies are sometimes the result of confusion or negligence, but more often they're the result of corruption, where dominant incumbents figure out how to put their thumbs on the scales to maintain their dominance and crush upstarts who oppose them. The more centralized an industry is, the easier it is for its dominant players to collude to achieve their common policy goals. Centralization is corruption's handmaiden.Democratic processes produce good governance. Without good governance, all bets are off: from information security to privacy, the game will always be rigged. And that's the conundrum: to get good policy, we need to decentralize. To attain decentralization, we need good policy.There's a lot at stake: the internet is more concentrated that at anytime in its young life, and it is growing to encompass every field of human endeavor.

To do this, we have borrowed many different ideas from traditional finance and in the process created a truly holistic foundation for a more rational financial system. In this talk we will dive deep on the philosophical similarities and differences between MakerDAO and the world of traditional finance.

Rigorous analysis shows that some non-profits are literally 1000s of times more cost-effective than average. Additionally, a significant portion of well-meaning philanthropic efforts produce little, or even negative effects on the problems they are trying to solve. Considering the many billions that are donated to charity each year, it is crucially important that all philanthropists develop the critical thinking skills to make these tough decisions - skills such as decision-making under uncertainty, correcting for bias and knowing when to (or not to!) use intuition.  I expect many of Devcon4’s attendees will strongly resonate with these concepts. As blockchain pioneers, they already understand the dire need for positive social impact on a truly global scale to ensure a safer and fairer future for everyone.

      description: "Crowdsourcing and crowdfunding has existed in the aerospace industry for decades, although usually they occur independent from one another. With the advent of cryptoeconomics, incentive systems can be designed that synergize crowdsourcing and crowdfunding in new ways to enable mass coordination in open source space development. Space Decentral is a DAO building an international citizen-led space agency, with a novel governance model and ultimate goal of bringing humanity together to collectively accomplish the impossible.  Project proposals are vetted and curated by the Space Decentral community, with curation leading towards project activation for volunteer-driven crowdsourcing. Ethical complications arise when volunteers help bootstrap for-profit entities without legal protections in place for ownership. To solve for this, Space Decentral's projects will use a tokenized task management system built on top of Aragon, that will track individual work contributions. By participating in Space Decentral, the expectation is: should a nascent mission spin-off into a new entity (such as a child DAO) each individual’s stake will be measured by the non-transferable tokens collected, which will be transparently accounted for on Ethereum. This new collaborative model is generic and can be applicable to any organization that wants to combine crowdsourcing and crowdfunding."

With Etherscan, you can verify, view, and interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Unfortunately, Etherscan’s functionality is mostly closed source, limiting transparency. In addition, end users must trust and rely on a single entity to provide valid information.  With the help of EthPrize (http://ethprize.io/) and the Ethereum Foundation, POA Network has been building an Open Source EVM block explorer called BlockScout (https://blockscout.com) to solve these issues. Our v1 release took place on October 9th, 2018 and we will be showcasing our open-source alternative to Etherscan.  Blockscout includes the standard ability to inspect blocks, transactions, internal transactions, tokens, and logs. In addition,  our v1 release includes:  contract verification contract read functionality exportable smart contracts for further verification from developers a responsive UI with real-time updates BlockScout can be configured for any EVM sidechain, and currently supports the Ethereum Mainnet, Kovan Testnet, Ropsten Testnet, Ethereum Classic, POA Core, and Sokol Testnet.  We've had the opportunity to work with many amazing developers in the space to build an open and accessible block explorer for the Ethereum community.

      description: "To enable smart devices of the Internet of Things to be connected to the Ethereum blockchain, an Ethereum client needs to run on hardware. While running a full-node or even a light-client on most IoT devices with low performance or restricted resources is not possible or meaningful, today's state-of-the art solution uses a remote client. By using distinct remote-nodes, the advantages of a decentralized network without being forced to trust single players are undermined and there is a risk of malfunction or attack because there is a single point of failure.  With the presented Trustless Incentivized Decentralized Remote Node Network, in short INCUBED, with a stateless minimal verification client it is possible to establish a decentralized and secure network of remote-nodes, which enables trustworthy and fast access to blockchain for a large number of low-performance IoT devices."

      description: "Axoni is developing AxLang, a Scala-based programming language for secure and reliable Ethereum smart contracts. AxLang code is fully Scala compatible and thus compilable to JVM bytecode with a vanilla Scala compiler. In this talk, we will present an overview of AxLang's compiler, which compiles a subset of Scala to EVM bytecode thus effectively allowing anyone to deploy and execute Scala on an Ethereum network.  AxLang's compiler is divided into two parts: a front-end and a back-end compiler. The front-end compiler is a Scala compiler plugin that transforms Scala syntax trees into an intermediate language (IL). The back-end compiler compiles this IL down to EVM bytecode. In addition, the back-end uses a standard compiler intermediate representation (IR) for robust optimization and analysis, a compiler norm that hasn’t been used by other EVM-targeting compilers to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, the back-end compiler can also be used by other languages as a target to allow highly efficient and secure EVM bytecode generation.  The ability to write secure and reliable smart contracts is critical to broad adoption of blockchain technology. AxLang aims to realize this goal and empower the Ethereum community to deploy smart contracts for business-critical and high-value use cases."

      featured: false
      description: "This presentation will introduce a statistical linting technique called S-gram for Solidity smart contracts. Generally, S-gram aims at finding bugs, stylistic errors, bad programming practice patterns in Solidity contracts. Unlike traditional approaches relying on program analysis which requires full/compilable contracts, S-gram offers automatic checking capability even for incomplete Solidity contracts, thus can help create better development experience where developers can almost code and check simultaneously. The key insight behind S-gram is that unusual code is more likely to be buggy. The likelihood is measured via probability computation in statistical language models, e.g. N-gram. Specifically, S-gram builds an N-gram model out of a corpus of “good” contracts (“good” means meeting stylistic specifications and having no bugs). Given an incomplete contract c, S-gram first parses it into a token sequence based on abstract syntax tree types e.g., AssignExpr, CallExpr etc. Then, S-gram calculates probabilities with respect to the N-gram model for all the subsequences of c and further flags less-probable code as suspicious. This presentation will also introduce preliminary evaluation on S-gram in terms of capturing real-world smart contract errors. In the end, this presentation will highlight the future tooling support to integrate S-gram with a Solidity IDE."

      description: "Off-chain scaling techniques such as state channel and side chains are able to support truly scale-out dApps with better privacy and no compromise on the trust-free guarantee.  Despite its high potentials, off-chain scaling is still in its infancy with challenges remaining unsolved. For example, how to construct state channels that support arbitrary state transitions with minimal on-chain operations? How to route payments to achieve high throughput in an off-chain network that is fundamentally different from data networks? How to help developers to easily build and operate scalable off-chain dApps? How to guarantee that off-chain states are always available for possible disputes?  In this talk, we will describe how Celer Network meets these challenges. Celer embraces a layered architecture with clean abstractions that enable rapid evolution of each individual component, including generalized state channels that supports fast and generic off-chain state transitions; a provably optimal payment routing algorithm that achieves orders of magnitude higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art solutions; a powerful development framework and runtime for off-chain dApps; and an incentive-aligned mechanism that provides stable liquidity and high off-chain state availability. We provide our vision for Celer Network 2.0, a grand unification of all off-chain scaling technologies into a single solution."

Perun allows its users to execute contracts off-chain via complex state channel networks possibly involving many intermediaries over which contract execution can be routed.    One distinctive feature of Perun is that its channels can be virtual, meaning that once a virtual channel is established transactions can be executed even without involvement of the intermediaries. This enables nearly real-time transaction execution with minimal latency at negligible costs. Moreover, privacy of transactions is significantly improved. An additional property of Perun is that its security is backed up by formal proofs using state-of-the-art scientific methods from cryptographic research. Besides presenting the main conceptual ideas of our system, we will outline some of the the major scientific challenges that need to be addressed when designing secure and efficient 2nd layer protocols."

Where are we so far? What have we learned about addressing the privacy and security concerns of people through design? What are the current best practices and thinking around designing experiences for interacting and managing your identity.

      description: "In this break-out session, a panel of well-renowned hackers and builders will  perform security assessments of contracts that the audience submits - and anyone in the room is highly encouraged to help out and take part in the process.   There will not be sufficient time to perform full-scale reviews, but the panel will discuss the contracts both from a high-level perspective and also dive into the nitty-gritty details, to see if we can find faults in the implementation.   This is a panel session, where we want to interact with the community and bash as many bugs as possible, and hopefully demonstrate how tricky it can be to program for the EVM.  Mistakes are what makes us learn: There shall be no shaming of anyone who submits a contract for review."

      featured: false
      description: "In the absence of a trusted party, Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocols are essential for the initial setup of any type of threshold cryptosystem. The DKG protocol results with every participant holding an individual key share, corresponding to some common secret (that nobody knows).   We use Ethereum as a decentralized trusted escrow to accommodate a DKG protocol for threshold BLS signatures. Participants enrol by depositing funds. They then run the DKG (a variant of Pedersen-DKG) protocol off-chain. In case a participant detects a deviation from the protocol, she files a complaint to the smart contract which arbitrates the complaint and slashes the malicious party. To enable arbitration over Ethereum we use precompiled contracts that were initially designed for fast (within the block gas limit) zkSNARKs verification and an interactive dispute mechanism.  Our smart contract consumes negligible gas in case no complaints occur and does not impose any limitations on the scalability (in terms of number of participants) of the DKG procedure. The slashing mechanism incentivizes correct participation.  Ethereum is used for two reasons: to mediate conflicts, and to incentivize correct participation. Our smart contract serves as a great example of a dapp."

      description: "Front-running is a fundamental problem in blockchain-based markets in which miners reorder, censor, and/or insert their own (or the highest gas bidder's) transactions to directly profit from markets running on blockchain economic mechanisms.  Submarine Sends (first introduced here: http://hackingdistributed.com/2017/08/28/submarine-sends/) are a powerful general-purpose mechanism to prevent front-running on Ethereum by hiding the very existence of a transaction until it is no longer front-runnable. Unfortunately, so far no practical (in terms of gas) Submarine Send constructions were known.  In this talk, we will introduce:  a freshly discovered, practical Submarine Send construction that works on the Ethereum mainnet today. LibSubmarine, an open source project implementing it."

      featured: false
      description: "Solidity's SMTChecker is a formal verification module that automatically tries to prove safety properties in Solidity smart contracts. These properties include checks for underflow, overflow, trivial conditions, unreachable code and user defined assertions. The checks are performed statically during compilation time, and the properties are either proved correct or a counterexample representing a bug is given to the user. Formal specifications for user defined properties are written using constructs already available in the language, therefore not requiring learning a new verification language/framework. If the formal specification is inaccurate or wrong, proofs are useless to the developer. Therefore, it is important to write specifications in a way that the target properties represent the program logic effectively. For the advanced user, some understanding about the SMTChecker may lead to specifications that also increase the module's efficiency and proving power. This talk gives an overview of the available features in Solidity's SMTChecker, and presents some insights on writing better formal specifications."

It's been an exciting ride to our mainnet launch, but there's still a long way to go for the mass adoption of Ethereum: embedded devices everywhere; universal access through simple, intuitive, and beautiful interfaces controlled by users; education; incubation and community building are all a big part of what we are doing.   Status Core App - an update on our latest release, the decisions and tradeoffs we've had to make so far, the lessons we've learnt by shipping a product onto the mainnet and how we plan to put the decentralised web in everyone's pockets with as few compromises as possible.   Developers & Extensions - how Status Extensions is changing the world. I'll dive into the tools we actually require to enable people to #buidl truly decentralised applications that do not need to compromise on critical aspects of their infrastructure in order to attract users with smooth and genuinely useful experiences. I'll also do a quick overview of #CryptoLife and how this showcases why Extensions and Embark are bringing Ethereum to life in more ways than one.   Nimbus - embedding the world computer in the real world. A new client we've been researching and implementing in an expressive, python-like language well suited to running on light clients. Built for Ethereum 2.0 and sharding, already experimenting with BLS signature aggregation, and all the other latest developments which will get Ethereum running in turn styles and PoS terminals near you. What does the world look like then?   Hardwallet - How do we ship the decentralised web into your pocket, but make sure you can transact securely? Store your keys on a card, tap the card against your phone when logging in or signing transactions and never worry about passwords again!   Ecosystem - Incubate + Studio + Embark = #buidling our ecosystem to bring real utility through Status for anyone and everyone working on making Ethereum.   Organisation - A look over our new principles, our Wall of Shame, and what it's been likely scaling from a dozen people to over one hundred in a year. The challenges and joys of working in a fully distributed and remote organisation, how we maintain horizontal structures, our plans to move toward a DAO and what it's like to try and replicate the ethos of a distributed network amongst people."

In this talk, we'll give an overview on the progress we've made and present our new release. Today many Ethereum dapp teams have 'working'products but neither can they launch their product due to mainnet's limitations (congestion/high tx-fees) nor can they improve their products since today’s non-value-bearing testnets don't cater to realistic testing environments. At the same time, strongly sought-after scaling solutions (such as Shasper) are either far out or not applicable to current generation dapps. Some of the points that will be covered in this talk are:  - Arbitrary message passing Bridge - interfaces, extensions, deployment and usage  - How can bridged sidechains mitigate current scaling issues of the Ethereum mainnet?  - How can they extend capabilities and be used to test potential, future mainnet functionality?  - What are important security considerations? (i.e. trust model, integration with different consensus engines & validator sets)  - Which tooling is needed and what's available today?"

      featured: false
      description: "Decentralization is the central value of Ethereum, but is often misinterpreted as supporting isolated individualism. Yet isolation is, paradoxically, a leading cause of centralization. Because most value creation and consumption is social, people need identity and economies have increasing returns to scale, decentralized systems that fail to account for these are quickly taken over by centralized power. Only by embracing the need for collective action through a diverse range of communities can we defend a decentralized society against the threats of authoritarian governments and corporate monopolies.  I will discuss three applications of this philosophy of liberal radicalism. The first is a set of formal funding rules for decentralized funding collective organization I proposed with Vitalik Buteirn and Zoë Hitzig that allow flexible, approximately optimal public goods provision without a central authority.  The second is a network-based identity protocol I am working on with Matthew Jackson that uses the community structure of information sharing to improve security without a dominant verifier.  The final theme will be the importance of collective organization of users of digital platforms to check the power of those platforms, based on my work with Jaron Lanier. Only such a social view can save decentralization from undermining itself."

Since the emergence of Bitcoin to the lime light becoming the buzz word of almost everyone a few years ago, much have been said and debated in the Islamic finance community whether or not it is permissible to deal with, whether it is halal etc. Blockchain has evolved a lot since then, with Ethereum now becoming the leading platform for the smart contract development. However, due to the complexity of the blockchain and cryptography concept, and also perhaps negative perception towards Bitcoin which previously was commonly associated with the excessive speculation activity in the market, there has not been much attempt by the Islamic finance community to tackle this subject in a serious manner. The Muslim community at large is still shrouded by ambiguity and uncertainty on the topic, and therefore one of the cause for the lack of participation and contribution by the Islamic finance community in the development of blockchain and smart contract application thus far. This presentation attempts to provide some insights and clarifications on the subject - Is Ethereum compatible with Islamic finance?"

      featured: false
      description: "We'll talk about real-world cryptocurrency use in avoiding forex controls, preserving one's wealth while fleeing an authoritarian regime, and escaping hyperinflation.  Venezuela is in a deep economic crisis of its own making: relentless money printing and disastrous fiscal policies have brought the country to the edge of collapse.  Eduardo will tell his own story of people using cryptocurrency as an unstoppable store of value and medium of exchange. He has some stories of people who were targeted by corrupt secret police just for using cryptocurrency.  Alejandro will introduce the Open Money Initiative and their research on how to allow Venezuelans to gain access to money that, unlike the dying bolívar, will not consistently depreciate 50%+ each month, and that anybody could use.   Enabling crypto adoption in Venezuela needs to be a team effort by the entire crypto community: entities like BitcoinVenezuela.com are already doing good work, and scaling them will be possible thanks to the support of projects like Zcash and MakerDAO."

As we think about governance in crypto, it's critical to understand the history of politics and law - because governance is inherently about human nature and behavior. Whether it's smart contracts, proof of stake, centralized nodes, or miner consolidation concerns, these are all rooted in age-old governance problems presented in a new form. In my presentation, I will cover the foundational principles of international law, its evolution, and how we can take those lessons and context and think about governance from a new perspective. Specifically, I will use examples of current global governance organization such as the UN (and its predecessor, the League of Nations), the ICJ (International Court of Justice), and the lessons that these organizations hold for the emerging field of crypto governance."

We focus on the variant of Plasma called Plasma Cash, which allows for highly performant sidechains in production, today. We discuss Plasma Exits and Challenges as well as explore the User Interface choices for Plasma Apps. We go over the challenges encountered during the development and final implementation of a Plasma chain and contract.  The presentation will highlight the advantages and disadvantages of using Plasma Cash, as well as practical examples of Plasma for Non Fungible Tokens and gaming. Finally, we'll talk about edge-cases such as griefing attacks, and future work towards making Plasma implementations more efficient, such as fast exits through liquidity providers, coin checkpointing through Plasma XT and arbitrary coin denominations through Plasma Debit.  The audience is expected to walk away with a detailed understanding of how Plasma Chains should be built as well as the inner workings of the Plasma Cash technique. More experienced individuals who understand but are not following Plasma actively are expected to walk away with an overview of the current status of Plasma research and development, and motivated to tackle the existing open research problems."

Also we will explore how Plasma Cash enables use of sidehains to speed up gaming. What are the UI/UX difficulties of Plasma Cash? What would having wallets on multiple chains look like. Can we have automatic sign transactions for users?  First we will delve deeper into L2 solutions like sidechain and state channels. We will see how plasma cash enables token transfers to sidechains, enabling the game to be fully run on the secondary layer. We will compare from a high level some common L2 solutions.   We will walk through the UI/UX choices, how existing wallets interact with Plasma contracts. Then we we will delve into the tradeoffs in UI to speed.  Finally we will tie everything together, by showing a working game that uses plasma, on a sidechain. So the audience can get the feel of what the end result of all this work would look like. What kind of games are possible and open up ideas for their future titles."

      description: "Current generation blockchains are by definition public... but how much public is too public? There is ample research going into making transactions private, hiding users'balances and computing verifiably off chain. However, nobody really focuses on the alarming amount of metadata we leave behind us with every one of our chain, explorer and/or dapp interactions. Even running our own nodes can expose a lot more about us to the world than most people realize or would feel confident with. In this talk I'd like to highlight some of the issues I see around metadata privacy within the Ethereum ecosystem, how those seemingly innocuous data leaks could be amassed and abused by aggregating actors and what we collectively might try to do to protect our users and the safety of our community members in the coming years."

      featured: false
      description: "Traditional cryptographic hash functions such as SHA-256 are well known in the Ethereum community and are well regarded for security and performance. However, they are not quite suited for SNARKs and STARKs as their circuits are too complex and slow in SNARK/STARK-friendly fields. That's why Zcash proofs originally took more than 40 seconds to create.  In this talk we present and call for new designs that will make all the SNARK/STARK crypto much faster and thus bring better privacy to Ethereum. In particular, we cover:   - existing algebraic hash functions such as MIMC.   - Merkle tree enhancements: wide functions and trees with feedback;   - improved algebraic function design using ideas from AES and SASAS schemes.   - performance overview;   - how new designs will affect EVM and smart contract programming. We will also present other directions and potential research bounties that can be offered to motivate the hash research, crucial for SNARKs, STARKs, and Ethereum."

      featured: false
      description: "Light clients, also known as Simple Payment Verification (SPV) clients, are nodes which only download a small portion of the data in a blockchain, and use indirect means to verify that a given chain is valid. Typically, instead of validating block data, they assume that the chain favoured by the blockchain's consensus algorithm only contains valid blocks, and that the majority of block producers are honest.  By allowing such clients to receive fraud proofs generated by fully validating nodes that show that a block violates the protocol rules, and combining this with probabilistic sampling techniques to verify that all of the data in a block actually is available to be downloaded, we can eliminate the honest-majority assumption, and instead make much weaker assumptions about a minimum number of honest nodes that rebroadcast data.  Fraud and data availability proofs are key to enabling on-chain scaling of blockchains (e.g. via sharding or bigger blocks) while maintaining a strong assurance that on-chain data is available and valid.  We present, implement, and evaluate a novel fraud and data availability proof system."

As of now, we have fleshed out a comprehensive architecture (https://github.com/MetaMask/mustekala/blob/master/docs/architecture.md) of four layers, where we extract data from devp2p synchronized clients and make it available in libp2p using the IPLD format. Upstream, an overlay network of peers (named kitsunet) shares this information, allowing data redundancy and decentralization at face value.  In terms of vision, in a close future low resource devices (browsers, mobile and IoT) should stop depending on JSON RPC communication with ethereum nodes. This is a huge problem today, as nodes became GB-sized machines. Last but not least, every MetaMask user will become a peer of a bigger and more inclusive ethereum network."

This platform is not only able to provide access to a huge amount of users and enable a lot of use-cases - it can also help us to improve security. For example by:   using old Android devices as offline signing devices using new systems like Android Protected Confirmation connecting hardware wallets like a TREZOR via USB-OTG, Bluetooth or NFC leveraging the application sandbox using separate devices for applications and wallets (with similar UX as 2FA) But these chances come with challenges. Not being able to run a full node on resource constraint devices and light clients still with problems left to solve (especially the incentivisation layer that helps having enough LES servers serving these clients) is the biggest topic here.   This presentation will also contain reasoning about design decisions for WallETH (a native Android Ethereum wallet) and the underlying Kotlin library KEthereum."

      description: "Enigma is a privacy protocol to enable privacy preserving smart contracts on Ethereum. Enigma utilizes secret contracts - smart contracts that let you use private and sensitive data in decentralized applications. Enigma is building a network for privacy preserving computations. Nodes in the Enigma network that execute secret contracts never see the data that is used in their computations.  In this talk, we would like to give an overview of the first version of Enigma network, which is currently on testnet, and present the roadmap with specific focus on privacy preserving cryptographic methods including Multiparty Computation (MPC) and Zero Knowledge Proofs. Computing over private data is considered one of the “holy grails” of computer science. With secret contracts, Enigma focuses on building blocks for the Ethereum network, such as voting / governance and auctions, in the short term. Longer term, Enigma enables applications on Ethereum that work with sensitive user data to compete with centralized solutions such as Uber. Enigma can also harden the privacy and resiliency of popular solutions like on-chain voting and sealed-bid auctions. Without privacy, applications and users must turn to centralized solutions or accept severe trade-offs."

In principle, token-based voting can empower the users of a utility token project to oversee its long-term development. In practice, however, a very large proportion of circulating utility tokens are held by speculators, rather than actual users. The talk will discuss our efforts to improve the utility token model through the introduction of a staking process that incentivizes user ownership. We will explain the process we followed to map our governance objectives into a specific staking mechanism. The talk will explain how this mechanism incentivizes ownership among a target user group, penalizes socially harmful behaviors, and collects and distibutes fee revenue in a manner that satisfies basic fairness norms."

Thanks to an Ethereum Foundation grant, the team has taken the idea of an 'accountable watching service' further to help alleviate the online requirement for other off-chain protocols such as Plasma and in general most smart contracts.\n\nWhat do we mean that PISA is usable by most smart contracts? Ideally, if we consider a smart contract where the user has to be online and watching for an on-chain event, then PISA can be hired to protect them (and perform the final step). Our goal is to help improve the UX for most smart contracts as users can simply go off-line and PISA can finish the task in a financially accountable manner.\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss the substantial changes to PISA such that it can be generically used for most smart contracts. We'll discuss the implementation of PISA, the open-source project, and how other projects can use our simple API to sign up to the accountable watching service."

      description: "1) Staking problem overview\n\nAs dPOS becomes a popular design pattern, staking tokens is an activity that end users for dapps and protocols are increasingly exposed to in order to get the required network participation. Since user interfaces for dPoS is still quite new for most, we hope to help you with your own design research by sharing some of our challenges and learnings unique to designing dPoS staking applications.\n\nAt Livepeer, we employ a dPOS approach to ensure the quality and security of the video transcoding services that our platform provides. Past studies showed that it took from 30 minutes up to 3 days for new users to figure out how to stake. This led us to ask the question: How can we make the experience so intuitive that even new users can go from signing up with a wallet to staking token in under 5 minutes?\n\n2) Research and design\n\nA) We conducted 15 user interviews with both current and new users and constructed a user journey of the current staking experience. B) Noting the pain points and feature requests from these initial talks, we then went on to do competitive analysis across 10 staking apps for prominent blockchain projects, taking inspiration from the best elements of each. C) Due to feedback about user confusion, while navigating our staking app, we asked users to card sort features on the current application to help us redesign information architecture. D) Lastly, we iteratively tested our redesign with clickable prototypes to create a brand new on-boarding experience and a brand new staking platform.\n\n3) Results\n\nOur A/B test of the prototype showed a significant improvement in the amount of time it took for users to go from signing up to staking token. 60+% of participants were able to complete the new staking prototype in under 5 minutes*!\n\n*Given that the user has already installed a wallet and has acquired Livepeer token."

While token sales have replaced a significant portion of venture capital in the crypto era, token buyers have not taken on the traditionally VC role in strategically supporting and growing startups over the long term. Though Ethereum’s Immaculate Conception was a miracle alignment of mission and crowdfunding, it left Ethereum with no formal VC backers, limited visibility on it's largest institutional investors, and no formal channel to communicate to them. Despite this, Ethereum has achieved incredible technical innovation and user growth, forging a new path of user-based funding and open governance that has impacted the fundraising landscape. But is there a middle ground? \n\nThis talk raises the question of whether the cultural and decentralisation mission risks of engaging VC’s and large institutional holders of Eth outweigh the potential benefits that VC’s could provide. It will also shed light on how just how much Eth institutional investors hold and why they hold it (TL;DR it’s a lot, and it’s because they believe). Competition among Layer 1 protocols for developer, enterprise, user and investor attention is rapidly escalating, and it’s worth considering whether our Ethereum community can remain true to its mission of decentralisation while still recruiting holistically aligned institutional investors as nodes to support and hone Ethereum’s growth in traditional areas from networking to business development, from recruiting and marketing and even to staking and regulation."

Unlike with simple anti-patterns like recursion, these security vulnerabilities have no obvious fix.  Join us for a deep dive into the state of the art bribery attacks that are technically feasible on cryptocurrency today, and their countermeasures.  We will introduce and explain new signature schemes that resist the ability for users to be bribed on Ethereum-based smart contracts.  We will teach developers of smart contracts how to build contracts that are maximally resistant to bribery, and provide practical tips for the protection of your users.\n\nLastly, we will show and launch a toolkit that provides signatures with protection from an advanced form of bribery known as the Dark DAO, in which users are bribed undetectably.  Our toolkit provides a simple API for any Ethereum contract to ensure the free will of their users through an easy-to-use library.\n\nBuilding bribery-resistant smart contracts is of critical importance for voting schemes, oracles, prediction markets, proof-of-stake and other consensus protocols, randomness generation, and more."

      description: "Will design ethics save software? As the broader tech community becomes increasingly uncomfortable with the structures and clients it serves, a growing movement seeks to integrate ethics into design practice. But this prioritises individual decisions and values over critical analysis of socio-political and economic outcomes. The pop discourse that calls for ethics indemnifies designers and obfuscates the inherent problems of their work, resulting in the celebration of projects that at their core problematic, such as digital wellness, decentralised systems, autonomous cars and inclusive facial recognition.\n\nBuilding on the essay “On Weaponised Design,” and an ongoing multi-year research and practice project with Tactical Tech and others, Design Ethics? No Thanks explores how design has enabled a decade of absurdity and examine how design ethics threatens to neutralise both the critique of outcomes and the potential contribution of design to a radically reimagined world."

      description: "The past few decades have experienced a dramatic if gradual transition from digital sovereignty and security being both attainable and in the hands of users, to both becoming out of reach.  Among the many reasons for this transition, the two most significant are changing commercial realities and the increasing complexity of modern electronic devices: Basically if you can't fully understand a device, you can't rationally trust it.  In this talk I will talk about my contrarian approach to this problem by crafting radically simplified computing devices, but that are still capable of useful work and providing convenient user-interfaces. It is also possible to create hybrid devices, where the complex parts are enslaved at the hardware level by the simple, open and sovereign core, creating what we call the Little Brother, and inverting the whole state of play for digital sovereignty and security in the process.  This is not, however all theory, but is being put into practice in a proof-of-concept device, the MEGAphone, a Commodore 64 backwards-compatible secure and sovereign mobile phone."

What if instead Bitcoin and Ethereum were like cash, a physical format that billions of people are intimately familiar with? To achieve a viable physical cryptocurrency, however, we need radically open hardware with cryptographically-secured guarantees of their face value and uniqueness anchored in silicon.\n\nWe propose a novel, low cost, physical format for cryptocurrency -- more appropriately \"cryptocash\" -- that's intuitive to use and allows for free, anonymous, and instantaneously final transactions. By isolating cryptographic key material and operations from software and firmware in secure silicon, we can build a new hardware foundation that supports not only self-ownership of crypto assets, but broadly serves to secure the secrets users need for participation in the decentralized web. We'll hone in how shared trust in hardware and chips must ultimately be quantified through crypto-economic incentives such that we can move away from manufacturers that willfully or ineptly include backdoors in their products."

Our current economy does a great job at assigning value to individual wants and needs, but shared resources (infrastructure, the environment, public goods, etc) and taking care of the less fortunate members in our society are not assigned any value at all. Instead, when entrepreneurs do value calculations (profit projections) they are incentivized to extract everything they can from \"externalities\" because that improves the numbers on their spreadsheet. This is an impossible battle to win for the nonprofit world. Nonprofits will not out compete for profit companies when the economic model is working against them.\n\nWe need to build new economic models around causes, so that we can actually attribute value to these \"externalities\" appropriately. I will introduce the various tools we have in the Ethereum space: Harberger Tax, Token Bonding Curves, DAO Governance Models, Escrows, Traceable donations, etc. and how they can be used to build parallel economic models to fill the gaps in the current system.

From investigating the use of the technology to increase transparency and accountability in government processes to reduce corruption, to encouraging inclusive supply chain deployments to moving ahead decentralized global trade identities.\n\nAs an impartial party to a number of industry-wide consortium efforts to solve key global issues, it is clear that collaboration, fair and well-designed governance systems are a key barrier to Ethereum adoption. I will share and explore lessons and insights learned from existing and in-progress industry consortiums, together with what good consortium collaboration and governance looks like in a decentralized setting.\n\nWhile the rewards from collaboration can be high, agreeing on what constitutes a fair and well-designed consortia governance system, let alone a joint blockchain platform, can be challenging. This is where many industry collaboration efforts have fallen apart.

      description: "For smart contracts to achieve mass adoption, they need the ability to securely connect to external off-chain data and existing non-blockchain systems. The reliability with which smart contracts connect to key external systems determines their overall security. This critical security factor determines whether smart contracts will be used to secure the many forms of value beyond tokenization, such as prediction market outcomes, insurance payouts, trade finance, and more.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll examine what makes a secure oracle mechanism reliable enough to be trusted by smart contracts for external data delivery, access web APIs, and off-chain payments. We’ll review the security risks and failure scenarios to avoid when using oracles and share how developers should set up methods to maximize success. We’ll examine how a decentralized network makes oracle mechanisms more secure, and how decentralization, combined with approaches like Trusted Execution Environments, can enable the highest level of security when connecting with external systems.\n\nFinally, we will show the design patterns which leading smart contracts use to remain reliable and provide high levels of overall security while connecting to external systems."

      description: "Many people in the crypto ecosystem have long operated under the same assumptions that Satoshi operated under in his original white paper: that we should assume that there's no trust among actors within an ecosystem, and that they'll make purely rational decisions to benefit themselves.\n\nSince then, we've seen the flourishing of tokens, each of which has their own communities with individuals orbiting at various distances. What we've seen practically is that in reality these actors do end up trusting each other in various ways (such as the way that BTC holders all trust each other to enforce a 21M supply cap), and that similarly, actors don't always act rationally (the proof for this point will be left as an exercise for the reader). \n\nIn light of these updates, it would serve us well to begin thinking of our protocol designs in a manner that not only incorporates the \"hard\" side (the one which treats actors like rational machines), but also the \"soft\" side: the one which takes into account human actors, their emotions, and the cultural fabric or \"soft layer\" which can sit atop the \"hard layer\" for a system to work in its entirety. This \"soft layer\" already exists informally -- on crypto-Twitter, in Telegram groups, through memes, and at the myriad of conferences which take place year-round in our space. However, there would be significant benefits for us as protocol designers to begin intentionally designing these soft layers alongside the hard layers (even though doing so will necessarily require the input of social scientists and not computer scientists).\n\nWhile many perceive extrinsic incentives (like reputation or value) as being at-odds with intrinsic incentives, this talk will illustrate (with examples) how the issuance and distribution of tokens can enable humans to connect with each other in a decentralized fashion, creating a force which unites them around a set of shared principles or goals. \n\nBy using tokens not just for utility or fundraising but rather as focal points around which communities may organize, we may begin to intentionally weave these cultural fabrics, to be more successful in building new communities and protocols."

The paradigm has become stagnant and is desperate for reinvention.\n\nThis talk will explore techniques to create highly scalable anonymous crypto-systems. These systems can create markets which empower humans to work together at scale and bypass the centralizing problems of corporations and the state.\n\nWe need to create a modern paradigm of technology that is focused on providing integral social infrastructure, rather than mere consumer products. \n\nFor this we must create the idea of the renaissance hacker and spread our philosophy through a system of academies which train people in sports, philosophy and technology. These academies will be centres of thought, learning and invention. The concepts we create will be turned into products which serve a market need and bring income to further expand our mission.\n\nOur goal is to develop the platform that will deliver the dark economy. The platform will leverage emerging anonymity techniques for innovative decentralized & dark financial instruments. We are firmly committed to transitioning humanity to the non-state ethical-philosophical paradigm through markets and technology."

At times it feels like an ‘80s buddy comedy, but as part of the Ethereum 1.x initiative, the process should become as predictable as a clock. In this talk, we will propose a regularly scheduled process modeled after Linux distributions and the Java platform that Ethereum could use for its future network upgrades.\n\nFrequent and regular network upgrades will remove the time pressure to submit and review EIPs, provide predictability to applications building on Ethereum and reduce the burden on core developers to begin implementing improvements that are not ready. Once a network upgrade leaves the station, another one will be coming right around the corner!"

      description: "How can we make blockchains secure at scale? We suggest a data availability and validity scheme that make sharding efficient in terms of the number of validators and validating resources. We first describe the Polkadot data availability and validity scheme and consider its applicability to other sharded systems (e.g. ETH2.0).\n\nIn Polkadot we tie an erasure coding data availability scheme with consensus, where we can not finalise an unavailable block. Moreover, reports of unavailability or invalidity trigger extra checks. The aim is that, with high probability, we do not finalise an unavailable or invalid block provided that there are enough honest actors to report.\n\nThe key advantage of this scheme is that we need fewer validating actors per shard and in turn, less total computational, and especially, networking resources. This softens the trade-off between scalability and security."

Developers are loathe to introduce significant changes, reasoning that a store of value should prioritize stable operation.\n\nWhile this cemented Bitcoin's place in the market, we all know the costs - Bitcoin's ossification at the expense of public experimentation and diverse use cases.\n\nIn 2014, the answer to this problem was \"sidechains\". Trustless sidechains are the ultimate vaporware- and since 2014 the goalposts have moved.\n\n- Approaches - \n\nBlockstream's Liquid touted itself as the \"first production sidechain,\" built on a multi-sig federation. No hashpower validates the sidechain -- funds are fully trusted to 15 Bitcoin multi-sig participants.\n\nBitGo's WBTC takes a similar tact-- but instead of building a new chain, custodians operate on Ethereum. Neat! Unfortunately, they require KYC :(\n\nThese centralized projects have a few custodians that can be convinced by governments-- or their own interests-- to censor or seize funds.\n\n- Design - \n\nWe propose a new approach-- the *bonded, multi-federated peg*. We believe this is the best candidate for a sufficiently trust-minimized alternative, unlocking Bitcoin for use in DeFi."

The relationship between today's Ethereum and the new system can be murky: does eth2.0 replace eth1.0? And where does eth1.x fit in?\n\nThis talk answers these questions by sketching the lesser known ways eth2.0 can directly benefit Ethereum 1.x. The two systems in fact complement each other as each phase of eth2.0 paves the way for tangible benefits to the network we all know and love. With Phase 0, we can upgrade Ethereum with the finality gadget, leveraging the proof-of-stake consensus to provide better security for the existing chain. With Phase 1, the proof-of-work chain can use the data-only shards to enhance the scalability of L2 solutions like zk-rollup and Plasma. With Phase 2, we can bring existing dApps into the realm of highly scalable smart contracts on shards with an upgraded virtual machine.\n\nParticipants will gain a better understanding of the many ways eth2.0 can help scalability in the near term and onward into the future. While the journey there may be dynamic and winding, it is clear that the future of Ethereum is bright."

      featured: false
      description: "Have you ever wondered what goes on under the hood of an Ethereum node? Frankly, most people don't care. If you are, however, running production systems with multiple nodes across geographical locations, knowing what your nodes do internally is more important than you might think.\n\nIt is a general fallacy to believe that a software either works, or does not. In reality, there is a whole spectrum in between. A software almost never works perfectly, rather there are quirks that may or may not affect your use case. These quirks may manifest only above a certain load or compound as time passes.\n\nThe only way to build out a robust infrastructure, is to accept that your nodes are quirky. Instead of getting surprised when they break - having no idea what caused it - you must always be aware of buildups and correlations to external stimuli.\n\nThis talk will present the suite of metrics that Geth exports for monitoring, highlighting why these have been added and why they might be important to you. By correlating your own load and use case with Geth's internals, you'll be able to gauge issues before they ever get strained enough to cause catastrophic meltdowns."

      description: "In Spring 2019, Taiwan’s Presidential Hackathon has successfully adopted the quadratic voting (QV) system so that the voting results for proposals are more in line with the needs of the people. At the same time, the Colorado state legislature in the United States had also used QV to vote on their budget priorities.\n\nQV is part of the recent “radical\" intellectual current. In 2018, the inventors of QV, Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Glen Weyl and Eric Posner from the University of Chicago Law School co-authored the book “Radical Markets.” In addition to the articulation of QV, the book offers five different proposals on how to change the way our societies are modeled. The book led to heated debates in academia and the community, and was featured by “The Economist” as one of the books of the year.\n\nGlen Weyl and Eric Posner believe that with regard to public affairs, individuals tend to hold different opinions and are reluctant to share their private knowledge with others. If more people can be encouraged to share their genuine opinions through well-designed market mechanisms, the society can work collectively to find better solutions to existing problems.\n\nGlen Weyl and Vitalik Buterin launched the RadicalxChange Foundation (RxC) to advance these principles. In this session, RxC board member Audrey Tang will discuss the current state of the RxC movement, in the form of interactive Q&A."
