title: 'Money is the killer Ðapp: crypto in Venezuela'
featured: false
description: "We'll talk about real-world cryptocurrency use in avoiding forex controls, preserving one's wealth while fleeing an authoritarian regime, and escaping hyperinflation.  Venezuela is in a deep economic crisis of its own making: relentless money printing and disastrous fiscal policies have brought the country to the edge of collapse.  Eduardo will tell his own story of people using cryptocurrency as an unstoppable store of value and medium of exchange. He has some stories of people who were targeted by corrupt secret police just for using cryptocurrency.  Alejandro will introduce the Open Money Initiative and their research on how to allow Venezuelans to gain access to money that, unlike the dying bolívar, will not consistently depreciate 50%+ each month, and that anybody could use.   Enabling crypto adoption in Venezuela needs to be a team effort by the entire crypto community: entities like BitcoinVenezuela.com are already doing good work, and scaling them will be possible thanks to the support of projects like Zcash and MakerDAO."
