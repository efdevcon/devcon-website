title: 'Money At The Edge: How People Stay Afloat in Venezuela'
featured: false
description: "The Open Money Initiative has gone into the field to understand how Venezuelans survive in the midst of heavy capital controls, criminalization of free markets, and hyperinflation. We'll share stories from places like Cúcuta, where worthless bills are used as art and home decor, and Caracas, where individuals are saving in bitcoin, trading it for local currency only at times of essential purchases. We'll discuss concepts for products and services in places where regimes have a tight grip on society, and how they relate to cryptocurrency."
speakers: 'Alejandro Machado'
bios: 'Alejandro is a computer scientist, product designer, and founder of the Open Money Initiative. He’s focused on inspiring and shaping digital money products so they can be used by more Venezuelans.'
